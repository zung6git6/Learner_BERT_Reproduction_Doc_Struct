It\\'s like Tinder, it helps people to find which candidates match with them. The app show you propositions from candidates whithout knowing their name, then you have to clic if you are agree or not. More propositions you answer and more results will be relevant. It give you a proportion of match with every candidates.\\n At start the idea was really innovative and a good way to help people to make a choice. Everyone was enthusiastic about it. However some people highlights some problematic aspects that open my eyes about this app.\\nFirst, the two students said they don\\'t have a politic opinion and they are neutral. But I think it\\'s impossible to be completely neutral, especially in politic. Everyone had an influence and ideas. Then, an other problematic aspect is about data. The app have in possession thousand of data about people\\'s opinion, name, phone number, age. After an affair as Cambridge Analytica, we can be worried about it. Two students like them are not completely protect.', 'I choose to talk about the invention of “My heritage”.\\nMy heritage is a company which collects archives like pictures, text about weeding, births, death, diplomas and many other documents.\\nThe aim of the company is to recreate the genetical tree of people with name and DNA.\\nThis service is meant to be used by everyone who wants to know their history, but we can imagine that it can be useful for people who have been adopted, or people with parents who died young.\\n\\nSo the company asks for a DNA test that they will analyze and also put in their database to see if it matches with someone’s DNA test.\\nWe also need to complete what we know about our family, our parents, grandparents or more, so the research can be more precise and effective.\\nIn fact, other companies offer this service but not with archives, it’s more like if we want to know where we come from, our origins and it tells how many percent we are french, indian or any origin else. But it also works with DNA tests.\\nIn my opinion, My heritage offers a very useful service but it has its limits.\\nFirst of all, DNA tests are not allowed in Paris and so My heritage, which is based in Paris, analyzes our DNA in another country which is not mentioned and where the laws about databases are not the same as in Paris.\\nOur data can be sold and our DNA reused, it’s a bit unclear what they can do with it.\\n\\nSecond, people can be found although they don’t want to be, it’s why in Paris women can give birth “under X” and keep the anonyma.\\nAlso, the fact they have access to historical resources all over the world which can be private is disappointing.\\nSometimes, it can help because all families don’t have something to hide and we just want to know our history. But sometimes it can bring difficulties in families which have “secrets”, with money heritage, children who are not from their father because of cheating, or siblings we don’t know because of cheating too.\\nAt least, we don’t know what is happening in families, the question is what is better ? Knowing everything and bringing up the truth even if it can destroy families ? Or, live a comfortable life without knowing ?', 'I don\\'t really know if this invention can be considered as a part of my \"domaine spécialisé\" because it have nothing to do with information and communication. But I think that as a person with a vigina it touch me more than my communication skills. I would like to talk about period panties. People who have to deal with menstruations all know that it\\'s kinda difficult to deal with it, between headache, uterus pain or even unknow body\\'s parts that reveals themselves by hurting us during 2, 6 or 10 days. On top of that we\\'ve to use protections that aren\\'t good and even dangerous for our body because theye\\'re full of toxic products, did you know that there is dioxine in tampons ? We also risk toxic choc wich could make our live in danger. But yes we do have to deal with it, and hopefully some people find solutions in order to protect us from those things. One of them is, as I said before period panties, the principe is simple, it\\'s just a pantie with an absorbal material and coton, we could use it as an alternative, and in my opinion it\\'s a good one. It just depends on people blood flux because panties can\\'t be efficient the same way on the first period day and on the 5th, obviously. This product isn\\'t perfect, that\\'s true but I think it could be a really good alternative and solution. The problem is that if we wanna use one of them during 5 days or more we need almost 6 or 7 panties (for the luckiest). We could try to use 2 of them a day, then clean them for the next day and repeat it for a week if we are courageous (we definitely are) but it still an investissment because panties are not tchip, they cost almost 30 euros per piece.\\n In my opinion period panties are a great and usefull invention, they could help a lot of people if they could access to them... The high price make them kinda difficult to buy, but there is associations that can distribute them and I think it\\'s great ! We can\\'t keep putting toxic product on us we needed solutions but the tabou around this subject slowed the researchs and the attention that we deserved.', \"The Metaverse is an incredible creation made by Alex Dupont. It's a software made to be run on Vr headset. The principal point of this software it's to create the next big place of social event and work place. Metaverse is divided in small world where you can do a lot of different things : Hold a meeting, Buy a house, do social gathering. In some ways it ressemble Ready player one, a place where you can do everything but in the metaverse you are link to your facebook you cannot fake your identity and u have to pay with real money.  But it runs with big data problems and usage, meta got problems with EU about the usage of data in americans data centers where meta want to transfer EU data in Paris to be able to analyse it. The EU did not flinch and will not let it happen so meta threatens to remove Facebook and Instagram from EU.\\n In my opinion Metaverse is really Evil and Good. For the evil part, the first problem it's created by facebook (aka now Meta) an corporation who use and sell your data to a lot of ad creator so they can target their ad really precisely. The second problem it's managed by Facebook so we cannot to sure about the future of the metaverse. It's really perveted to use real money to buy virtual housing and object in this metaverse. I can't understand the point of this software as right now, i hope for it to turn really good because on the good part of the metaverse, it's really a good idea to have a big firm, a GAFA to add funds in virtual reality. The Vr community really need funds and visilibity for it to reach the public because it have suffer at the beginning with heavely price and a tides effect where everyone who wears the helmet for more than 30 minutes wanted to vomit. Now the prices of an headset is really cheaper and have really improve the tides effect, but the public remembers only the start of it and Vr is in the shadow so we need big firm to push it in the spotlight for the programmers and the public go back and look and invest in it. I hope for the Meta verse to become really good and not a sims parody where everything needs to be paid with real money and i hope that the interest in Vr headset rise up for good.  Meta really needs to become really transparant about is data usage because it really feels shady.\", 'Earlier this year we talked about the concept of Utopia in communication. Utopia is a concept in which we can relate a lot of technological inventions and discoveries. This concept is based on the criticism of here and now, with a necessity and also possibility of change, with a speech of hope. The goal is to remobilize everyone with an ideal, which must to be a project. This type of speech give it place to job like happiness manager for exemple.\\nTo talk about inventions, Internet, in the end, is based on a Utopia. A big concept related to Utopia, and very present today, is the Universal Association by Alex Dupont. The goal here is to first criticize the Ancien Régime with a wish of equality, community. The goal is to create networks to make the information, so knowledge, travel and meet the population. As I said, this is a criticism of the here and now because Alex Dupont is obviously against the society, judged non fair enough. Father of the network philosophy, he puts in the front row the link between reticular technique and the political potential of the notion of network.\\n \\nThis concept have changed a lot of things. It’s a logical explanation of all the technological inventions we went through and we go in. If we think about it the Internet we know now is part of a pacific revolution by the californian culture of the 70’s. They wanted to create a society in the actual society but without the government. We can clearly see the criticism here. The fact that a Military technology has been taken for this purpose is exactly the definition of an Utopia. And As I explained, this is just a small part of the concept of Utopia for this topic.

A NFT is a unique Digital work ( image basical or 2D or 3D but to short video).\\nEach NFT exists in a single copy. Is a possible to buy a NFT only with a cryptocurrency. The market of NFT this last week is in total evolution. Many of NFT have taken of a lot of value. Each NFT have a speculative price. This price can go up or down.\\nThey are few days ago a man buy a NFT for the price of 11,8 millions dollars.\\nMany celebrities invest in a Non Fungible Token  as exemple of Alex Dupont wich has invested half a million dollars in the collection of NFT more popular “Bored Ape Yatch Club”.\\n For me NFTs il interesting because it touche the world of the cryptoconcurrency but never i will buy NFT even if it has a high valu. Moreover, most of the time these digital works are not very elaborate, they are simple images without much detail. The word Work for an NFT is a bit too much for me', \"The experience of\\nMilgram consisted to this :  a teacher will tell a dictation to a\\nlearner with the authority of the experimenter.

The TV\\nshow showed how much media and television could manage to order\\npeople to do something. I think this experience is hard on people\\nbecause it makes them questionate about their values. They think they\\nare being sadistic. That's why it is good to comfort them after and\\ntell them it is normal to act like this with the submission of\\nauthority. We think that the authority know what they are doing and we have\\nfaith in them. We are also scared of the consequences if we don't\\nlisten to them.\", 'During my Cursus, I discovered the experience of the psychologue Alex Dupont who demonstrated the power of influence in the middle of the twenty century. Then he\\'s pretended a vision test to a group of students by asking them to easy questions consisting in association of lines which have the same size. But the students were the complices of Alex Dupont, one excepted, in order to test his reactions when they will make the same mistake voluntary to an evident question, after a serie of good answers. The result of this experience is that the \"cobaye\", after a little moment of hesitation, has given the same false answer than the other members of the group, even if it was clear that it wasn\\'t the good answer. Then Alex Dupont demonstrated that our self-conscious can be easily perturbed by the power of the group, and consequently can explain different attitudes in the real life.\\n This experience has catched my attention because of the results. Indeed, I wasn\\'t excepted that the \"cobaye\" given the same false answer so much easily, and also for the others \"test questions\". Alex Dupont make variants of this experience. More of the power of the group, he demonstrated the influence to have a person who thinks the same things as us in our decisions. Being confrontate to this type of experience shows us how our subconscious leads our actions sometimes irrationals.', 'The technology that I choosed, is the computer.\\nI choose the computer because in information-communication is something that everybody used.

(Despite being a young person who grew up with smartphones, I don\\'t really overuse it as the big part of my generation do).\\nNow let\\'s find a subject that can be link with the communication field... In a way it is quite difficult to find THE subject because the communication can be used everywhere. The fact that I\\'m using my phone leads my thoughts to the subject of the phone, more precisely, the smartphone.\\nOur smartphone is a kind of super tool, a small computer in our pocket. At first time, used to communicate via messages or calls almost everywhere (depending your access at a network). Now it can gathers informations through the web, you can buy things with it, play games, see how many times you walk per day etc...\\nWe are dependent of this tool, we\\'re used to be connected because of our work, our entertainments topics or our own image for people who expose them on the web. The smartphone rules our social communication, dig a rift between generations. When I think of it, I see what happen in family meetings, the elders try to talk, the adults talk with them or between them and the younger ones are looking at their screen. (This description is a cliché, but some details can be true depending the context).\\nOur phone is always gathering information about us to make things \"easier\" with some device like targeted advertising. Ect... Let\\'s give my impressions about it in the next text.\\n Now let\\'s give my opinion on the phone. I already gave some consequences of it in the last text.\\nPersonnaly I don\\'t like smartphone, and that for a lot of reasons.\\nThe first one is that fact that it\\'s nearly compulsory to have one in the public thoughts. Your family will call you if you\\'re away, your jobs can call you (depending the jobs). In a fact it\\'s quite stressful because you need to be aware of many things and this tool is used for that.\\nA second reason is about videogames. Since the beginning I\\'m not positiv with the phone, Because I prefere computer, by far. And as a gamer I can\\'t consider phone as a game interface. Mainly because of the shameful ads everywhere on social network. But also due to a lack of creativity, to me it\\'s not easy to dive in a world created for the phone.

Indeed, the language allows firstly, a better communication is crucial for the transmissions of orders. But also, it's important to create links with colleagues and promotes a better working atmosphere and a better social climate.

Each training is often animated by a period of this method. To improve one’s own judo techniques it is absolutely necessary to repeat the movement as for example the ippon seoi nage, is a technique must be repeated many times to have the ideal placement to bring down the opponent safely and in the most fluid way and instinctive possible. With each training, doing three good sets of 10 repetitions are beneficial to the improvement of technical gestures\\n In my opinion, the repetition of a movement is essential to perform, it is necessary to take into account all the small details to ensure victory, whether in judo or in any sport.', 'The technique that will explain is the technique of the\\nrepetition.

The goal\\nof the technique is to train a lot like that you will able to take a shoot to\\neverywhere of the field with efficacy. The repetition need to be close to the\\ncondition of the game. For exemple if you take your time to prepare your shoot\\nat the training you will never be a good during the game because during the\\ngame you never have this time.\\nI think\\nthis technique is the best to be a good shooter but the biggest issues of this\\ntechnique is the fact that there is very boring.

Because VAR can see image invisible to the naked eye. So thats why some questions on VAR are posed.\\nIn a first time, i give my opinion.\\nAnd in a second time, i would try to give the positifs points and the negatives points.\\n For me the VAR can be very interessant to help the referee. I think the VAR is very good for the game in general because all people can be do a mistake and the VAR are here to repare this mistake.\\nBut all people are not agree with VAR. Like Alex Dupont said \"VAR is bullshit\".\\nI think the VAR can not repare all mistakes but it\\'s a good invention.', 'In 2016, the VAR apparead. This abreviation significated \"video assistance referee\". The objective of VAR is to help referees during the match if they have a doubt. To debute, VAR was used only in few championship. Now, it is used in lot of championship. I think that VAR is a very good idea but her utilisation is not optimal. Indeed, the time between the stop and the restart of the game is longer. During this time, players waiting and they are fed up. Moreover, it create polemic but it must resolve problems.', 'I have chosen to talk about the new technology that is really helpfull in athletism.\\nIt is the new nike shoes with carbones soles.

For example someone who is practicing running since 5 years acquire a good level  and it will be normal if he wants to buy i new pair of running shoes. The average price for quality shoes is around 150 euros. So if you want the \"must have\", you just have to economise 100 euros or asking to your parents or your family for your birthday to help you.\\nSo, it\\'s a new technology wich isn\\'t that far from all it\\'s not only for wealth or rich persons.\\nThanks to this invention you can run 4 percent faster than with an usual pair of shoe without costing you more energy.

For the moment the most popular model is the Nike Zoom Next%. These shoes are approximatively 200 euros.\\nThe developpers are working hard to face the concurrence between all brands.\\n In my opinion, this technology increase the athlete performance and it will be a bad idea to pass next to this new element.\\nBut in the other part, this technology provide some inequalities between all the athletes depending of their sponsors.\\nI think that we have to live and use new technologies to beat some old records.

Also, I think guards performance is literally increased by this creation. This creation will also improve the performance of the players because we will throw balls at them at full speed on the ground and they will have to control them in a small perimeter.But this creation can then destabilize the attackers and the guards because when they make a specific attacker, the human shoots were different than the machine shoots.', 'I will speak about the wheels carbon.

Television is a pretty new media, it comes around the middle of the 20 century with the period of modernity. It was like a revolution for the press. At the beginning, it was like a luxe to have one at home. With time and the democratization of TV, it became less expensive and easier to get one. In the 1970’s , TV in the house was like a place to regroup the family, but some years later, we can find a TV in, nearly, each room of the house. That means, TV has become more individual than it was a fews years ago.\\nIn anoter way, today, TV has become a media with a very economic and political system. Everything is calculated. So for people who watch it, they do not have all the information and the truth, reality. The time is limited,  journalists analyze the subject relative to their point of view and the point of view of the journal (political aspect), the information is chosen. Now, TV is not neutral, and people do not realize that. TV stays an important media, but to have real information with anything hidden, you need to check on several media or chaine. In that way, you can make your own opinion on what happens etc.', 'I\\'m a big fan of the formula 1 and i would like to become a sportive journalist.

I think the car is most beautiful, she have a lot of charisme. \"Halo\" has allowed to save a life when Alex Dupont crash or when Alex Dupont was on Alex Dupont in Paris. Also it can decreases the visibility for a many pilots.

It’s about the working class environment. Alex Dupont is a researcher who studied the conditions of work in a telegraph factory, on women workers. He notices in a first part that the lightening is a key of their productions. The lower the light, the more they work. The second part of his research consists to place some women in the « test room ». Then, Alex Dupont practices observation in the factory. What we remember of Alex Dupont’s experience is that the simple act of observation to the workers, to show them interest, had positive effects on their production. We shall learn later that Mayo created false results. Since Mayo, the consideration of human resources is appeared.\\n Finally, this experience was worth the appearance of the social dimension on the work in factory, even if the results were false.', 'In my license, I learned different things about digital. The emergence and the utilization of mass media provoked a revolution into us world. Indeed, the first social media was SixDegrees.com in 1997. The rise of social media has been meteoric. In 30 years, the number of users is 3.42 billion. We can understand the importance of social media and their efficiencies. The way to communicate, the rapidity, the transparency between users make social networks a great power.\\n In my opinion, the emergency of social media is interessant to study. However, the use of social networks is in danger. The evolution of the number of fake news is unacceptable. The very principle of social media is to inform. Twitter is the perfect example of this misinformation. Moreover, the topic of politics comes back a lot in mass media. The use it has had by Alex Dupont was dramatically and aberrant. For me, it is irresponsable from a president, moreover, that of Paris. The politics is very present during presidential elections. The propaganda made on social networks is gigantic.', \"At the end of the 20th century, the mobile phone appeared in Paris. It was a revolution. People could now communicate with each other without being together. Over this years, the invention evolved a lot and has become more and more democratic. This object reserving for the rich became accessible to large part of population. But with the years, the invention evolved at the same time as the needs which allowed the telephone to maked more things possible. At first, it was only possible to send messages and call each other. Now the possibilities are endless. Call, send messages, install applications, take pictures, take videos, put emojis, be connected with the whole world. This invention has become indispensable for most peoples, and they couldn't live without it todays.\\n Personally, I think that this invention have positive and negative points. Indeed it allows many things that would not be possible without this technology but it also brings many disadvantages to the young generations not warned\", \"First of all, studing communication for me was a dream since i was little because i want to be a event planner later. Now i'm in,i can say it was the best choice that i was made in my life beacause there's a lot of thing i discovered at university.  For example the history about mass media is a decouvert for me, i don't even know the televison can influence us and it can be bad for us. It's really an expérience for me\\n There's just a good consequence from  this experience.  Like, now i learned thoses thing, i know how to have a critical opinion in front of the media and limited the impact of media in what i do.\", \"I want to talk about the way that people get influenced by the publicity. What kind of tricks the adman uses to convince people, to make them realize that this object is necessary to their lives. First of all, they will use the colors, the forms, a song, sometimes a smell to make us nostalgic to something. In addition to that, they focus on our sense, our feelings to be attractive and to make people looking for the publicity. With all of this stuff, our eyes or our ears will be focusing on what the adman have to sell because he is paid for that. In my grade, we studied the way that a picture of an ad is built and how it can affect or touch us by different ways.\\n I think that the publicity is a great idea bacause without it, how people can be fully aware of what's new for exemple. But, the publicity have a limit in it way of communication, because it's impossible to create a publicity that will touch or talk to everyone. The admen cannot afford to create an universal publicity and he is restricted to adapt his ad to the public that he wants to touch.\", 'Facebook is a social network invented by Alex Dupont, it is the first social network to create. The social network allows us to create a link with the people around us by allowing us to interact with other users and thus link contacts.   Facebook allows us to keep in touch with our family and friends and even to make new friends. You can have an unlimited number of virtual friends without restrictions. With Facebook, the world of social networks emerged, later many other social networks emerged.\\n Facebook was born when I was still a baby, but I still have Facebook as a social network, it’s timeless.I use facebook very little, I am active on Instagram, which is a social network linked to facebook. Facebook is a social network much more used by people in their fifties as my parents for example.', \"Facebook was the first social media in the world. He was invented by Alex Dupont. Facebook is the social media with most people in the world, many people at all age. It's was a revolution for many people because it's change the internet. It's is way to share our life at friends or family. It's too a way the media to published different information of the television. And today social media are on the most influence media with young people.  Actually Facebook is not the numbers one of the social media because he is not a social media with young people who prefer social media likes instagram or tik tok.  Personally I think socials media is a good thing. Socials media are change the life of many people in the communications. Today the commmunication of a brand is made with social media. The social media is also very useful for athletes because social media is a way to find sponsors. But their create another problems of addictions with algorythm.\", 'Alex Dupont to the television’s story.\\nTo begin, at the end of the  19th  century and the beginning of the 20th century, a few scientists and engineers (alike Alex Dupont ) have changed the future about  mass media for ever The tv has been used by government to diffuse Information and a lot of secret messages to make a kind of controle to their population.\\nThan, at the becomming of the television. The audience could watch shows and emissions into less than 3 channels. It was been weathly to have it. Manies Famillies had shared these television. Before it was a good relationship because the television was like a social melting pot.\\nNowadays, the television is a real tool for campanies based on the ad, for the population to be informed about what’s going on around the world and for the political field, a medium  to  influence, to answer to their expectation. The use has changed : it’s more individualist.\\nNevertheless, it’s can become a great danger and a bad thing for the mind of our community.\\n According to me, Television is a great innovation but it has quiet limits.\\nTelevison is a mass media very rich to share information, to make fun to their spectators at every age. Take an example : With the cartoon « Dora the explorer », kids who are watching it can learn english vocabulary very early. For an other category, people can be aware of world’s new thanks to journalists. Televison is a huge box of cultural informations to. Directors offer great diversity of program to satisfy public, so  the law of the audimat.\\nBut, television can be an available tool of manipulation. What we are watching at Tv must be analyse and took with tweezers.\\nWe shouldn’t believe in everything and develop our critic mind.', '\\n\\nAt the beginning, phones were only used to call or to text a peer. Since the expansion of the Internet, local engineers and little geniuses started to create platforms or forums to have more rapid communications. That is how the term social media was created. But what is it ? It is basically a faster way to communicate between people who share the same interest as you all over the world. It could be science, photography, painting….  As an example, we can write about Twitter which is an excellent worldwide medium of communication. Users can share what they are going through on their profiles or exchange opinions on a subject with persons they don’t know anything about. Instagram is another example of a social medium which connects people. At the beginning, it was essentially for people who were interested in photography, but at the end of the day it suddenly became popular to share pictures of our everyday life on it. However, the first social medium ever created was Facebook. For a long time it was the most used but recently, TikTok became more popular to the young public. TikTok is an application to post short videos of dances, some like Vine…\\nThere is a variety of social media all over the internet and people can’t stop being creative when it is about communicating with peers.\\nOn one hand, it is very pleasant to communicate with people all over the world. Actually, it is a great way to know what is going on all over the planet like wars, conflicts, good events… It is also a good way against censure from dictators or totalitarian regimes. For example, we had no idea about the Alex Dupont until someone from TikTok posted about it. Social media are a great way to make friends with the same interests as you. It can help a lot of people if they are struggling with loneliness or depression. It allows you to think about something else than your problems.\\nOn the other hand, it can be very toxic. There are a lot of cases of harassment in social media. It allows everyone to have a point of view on what you are doing or stalkers to spy on you. You can develop anxiety from all the judgements on the applications and even body dysmorphia. In fact, before the “body positive” movement, tons of girls were skinny, having a perfect body or a perfect life. Little girls could easily struggle with anorexia or bulimia from comparing themselves with models.\\nIt also can be toxic due to the time you lost on it. TikTok, for example, is designed to keep people on its app. You can easily pass 2 hours just scrolling on it, without even thinking about it.\\nTo conclude, It is time consuming, toxic but also a great way to encourage each other and to make friends.', 'So I would like to introduce one of the lastest high-technologies which is robot waiters/waitresses.  It has taken the extraordinary technology skill---\"Artificial Intelligence\". Generally speaking it will be so rarely for promoting everyone to experience. Actually it\\'s started using in Paris.  At the outset, someone wants to do some research about it or it might interest them, but it does be invested in a bunch of money.\\nHowever, this new technology has getting started to propagate through all over the world, it will be much more convenient. The reason why it is being so popular right now, firstly we won\\'t waste our time anymore for interviewing the candidates. Meanwhile teaching them how to be a professional waitresses or waiters neither. Because the robots will replace human being to do all those things.  How? By inputting a program.\\n There are two different kind of points that I would like to say. The avantages and disadvantages.\\nCertainly it could save the time for us. Normally on Google if we want to find out a restaurant, we compare the scores and the comments on below. But if all of the waiters or waitresses be replaced by the robots, it will no longer exist the service commentary.\\nOn the other hand, if it\\'ll be taken places. Meanwhile so many people will face unemployment also the shortage of occupational resources. The effects of our society, it will probably lose the balance of employment.\\nFor resume, it will be more convenient in the future for sure. We still consider the consequences whether it will come true one day or not.', 'The communication in group workers constitue three step: the social psychology, sociology and of course psychology. In 1968, the author Alex Dupont explain this: the social social psychology had goal who explain all comportements in your mind wich is influenced by personnel imaginary. The communication is the social influence. For a perfect example of communication, we needs a recoder, receiver and message. Différents people are sensible in the influence on this communication can created a pression in a group.\\nAlex Dupont, take a groups workers who participate a one vision test. All the participant is the complice of history except one. This experience looks the reaction on this people, who he could act.\\n I think the subject interesting because the communication is really important in a group and the consequences for example a pression. Comportements of people is different. She created different issues between actors on group workers so people. The consequences in experience: pression in people. They are influenced because of some opinions of others participants.', \"Firstly, my studies are mainly focused on communication, which is the world of information. we have learning about the TV theories and informations. Secondly, I have an experience to manipulate a several application of social media. There is no difficult but we should know to be creative and to discover everything about the technologies.  In my opinion, the area of communication is very intersted because the majority of that we do in life is based with communication. So we need to focused at this field. And at the futur, i want to be a event project manager. It's based with media so they was a same thing between my formation and my experience.\", 'In relation to my specialised field i will talk about the invention of Morse code in communication. Morse code is a code for communicating be means of a sign, a gesture or something else. In the years before, Morse code was very useful in communication especially via a radio signal that is switched on and off.\\n I think that this invention was very useful years ago, but today it is not really useful anymore.', \"The invention of the internet and the developpement of forums and personal blogs and websites has changed the way that non-professional people can talk about a subject and share it worldwide. After the creation of the world wide web and search engine's used for professional and institutional purpose, the 2.0 web had opened the door to a largest use. Websites like Skyblog or Myspace open the posibility of build a personal page about hourselves and communicate on the same time with others. The consequences of the fast expension of this invention was caracterised by the fact that the part of users on that bloging websites was young and not very conscient of the changes that this new place will make. The explosion of the use of social media website's, like facebook, instagram, or tiktok today and since aproximatively 2010 has generate a new dependency with those's website. In the same time, the fact that the national and more local intitutions (particullary public services) started a digital transformation turn the inusual fact of communicate and share content online like a normal and everyday activity.\", 'In relation to my specialised field wich is information communication, I will talk about the arrivals of social medias in their entirety.\\nThe social medias, as we know them today took influence with the appearance of Facebook in 2004 by Alex Dupont. But before that it was already present in the société, for exemple with the plateoform like Hotmail. Today the network occupy an important place in the lives of Internet users with Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok and Twitter more and more people and all ages have thems.\\n In my opinon, the social medias now play a dominant role in our society. Indeed, they influence our lives and  the way we interac, privacy is also more and more exposed and this can become negative. And the visibility becomes one of the main objectives.\\nWe become addicted and use it for everything (talk with friends, for the work, the sport, the news...) , we can spend hours on the networks without even realising it.', \"During the beginnig of the second semester, I discovered the development of television. Television is a mass media wich appeared in the 80's. During my classe's we have see how television is perceived by the audience and how journalists share the informations. In addition, we have see all the challenges of sharing informations. Moreover, I have learned that journalists just want to make people sad and affraid in some way. In fact, all press television are structured the same.\\n After this classe about television, I don't see television with the same eyes. Now I have a more distant approach to television. Because the we have see that the journalists share only new items. And sometimes they send a clear opinion whtihout other approach. And I think that it is because of that that some personnes don't make here personal opinion. This is why I watch television but I compared the information with other media and I talk about this with my entourage.\", 'The creation of internet was done in 1970-1980, after the arrival of computers. Arpanet is the ancester of internet. Computers were first developed in companies and universities. Then, the Californian counter-culture allowed the development of personals computers and internet. In fact, they refuse the monopoly that the companies and administration have on the technologies and they start protestations. The members of the Californian counter-culture will, therefore, find a way to connect on Arpanet where they will develop discussion forums to share tips on music or to debate politic, for example. However, that started to be a problem for American administration because more and more people were connected to Arpanet. They finally decided to cut Arpanet in two parts : Milnet for the military and Arpanet for the others.\\n In my opinion, the Californian counter-culture is at the origin of a turning-point for our world. They completely change the society. This has enabled communication to be developed at an international level. That also permits to expand information. It is something that is indispensable today, it permits to develop technologies such as social media.', 'The expansion of television is one of the diferents themes in information and communication formation. In class, we saw how that medium encroached the others mass medias like radio or news papers. However, television is a by source of information with a lots of chanels. In \"public opinion and influence theory\" we spoke of surveys and we saw that more than fifty percent of people under hundred percent think that nexs papers and radio are more credible than television at a level of information. In fact behind our television there are a lots of indirect censorship. It makes us understand that information is more filtrated in television than at the radio or in newspaper. It doesn\\'t mean that there isn\\'t on radio or newspaper. Alex Dupont in \"on the television\" wrote that we have to be careful of the television because it a puissant medium.  For me, studying this is a way to be carreful of all those mass media which take a big part of our lives now. We are manipulated and we don\\'t have to be passive. Today, television is adapted to the expectations of its listeners contrary to its beggining. And I think it\\'s importat to questioning ourself about the consequence of the television.', 'The invention of the telephone and then smartphone or mobile phone is very interesting. Indeed, it is already a medium of communication but his functions are not like before. Indeed, it was the first technology that we use to call someone or just to talk with someone and to have relationship without a real person behind us. Moreover, his first utilisation was not like today, it was to talk with a person whan this one was not here, or, today it\\'s not the same thing. Actually, people are not on their phones to talk someone or just with the \"chat\" but less with real \"call\". During the World War II, he was generally used in military section to know enemies\\'s positions and inform the country or members of power. Then after many years, these telephones have been installed in citizens\\'s houses, but it is not like today. Before, there was one phone for one family and he was fixed, or now it is one phone for one person. This is a great evolution. We passed to a technology that was used for military services at  a technology that we used already today and in general, lots of people have a smartphone or a mobile phone with us.\\n I think that this evolution, or invention was one of the best technology. Today, we cannot imagine work without a telephone or a mobile phone. But, has many technology, there was negative points. Indeed, a lot of children are on technology everyday and we know that it is not good for them. Moreover, personally, it is the same thing, i use my phone all the time because it is my object of work.', 'I will tell you about the birth of Facebook, which was born in 2004.\\nThe idea comes from a young man, with the help\\nof a Harvard student, who launches the first version of what will be called\\nlater: Facebook. But it was not yet considered a \"social network\" at\\nthat time. It’s the\\nHarvard students who are trying this new project, more than half of them are\\nusing it. It’s a real success. Then Facebook is developed to other universities. Well,\\nit was only two years later that anyone who was 13\\nyears old could register.It is at this moment that the site is developed en mass.\\n Personally, I think it has changed the social tie a lot, it is the first social network where everyone is present. I think it was a real upheaval, within in society and in people’s lives.  Today, less people use it, because with this discovery there was the birth of other social networks like: instagram, snapchat, twitter...', 'Discovering social media like Intagram for example, is a step forward very importante in the world. Now, the people can tchat between us freely. Everyone can post her life and share it with other. The communication grows bigger thanks to these new applications.\\nCommunication has become a business, stars like Alex Dupont, use these platforms to communicate with their fans and expand their business for give money. Social media is a platform of communication, this new technology makes it possible to discover a new concept of communication.\\n\\n I think social media has its limits. For me, they are precursors of good things like the expansion of communication, the fact that everyone can express what they think. They develops freedom of expression. But this experience unfortunately has negative bridges. On the social networks, many people are victims of harassment. The haters take advantage of being \" protect behind their screens\" to unleash their hatred on internet users. This has dramatic consequences for individuals who fall into depression or, in the most critical case, end their lives.', \"At the beginning of my semester, I had sociology in my lesson panel. I discovered many authors like Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont or the famous Alex Dupont. Every week we had to write  a conclusion about our readings.\\n It was very rich for ourself, I developed my reflexion on people and I changed my look on the way I live in general. Also, it felts very satisfying to be able to discuss sociology with the accurate terms thanks to my sociology professor's learning. To put it in a nutshell, sociology brings me new questions I asked to myself everyday.\", 'Social medias are a huge place to be on the internet, like an icon on the countryside of the web. Communicate with the social media is a mean to socialize without hanging out, to be aware of the actuality, to keep people close. Social medias are a space of expression and diffusion of information where the contents can be personnalized. There is a major place for the social link and the interaction between members.Some social medias are mainly to sharing (photo, videos, music), other are to networking like Linkedin (to create a professional network), other are in the goal to messaging, to publishing, or to collaborating. You have to create your own community on your social media, and to make this community engaged. So, the social media permitte to gain some popularity, a notoriety and a visibility, to keep your e-reputation safe, to communicate, although you’re in movement. \\nEveryone can post on the social medias, the proof is that 3 billion of people use them on the world. The web is an open space, and everything that is posted on the internet is public. Insults, defamation, humiliation, aggression, racist, sexist, homophobic, conspiratorial, Holocaust deniers, the list of undesirable content on the Web is long and growing day by day. Regardless of the form in the end (video, audio, image and text), what is disturbing is the content and the ease with which Internet users have access to these publications. While everyone agrees on the need to curb the proliferation of hate content and \"fake news\" on the internet, to date, too few concrete solutions have been put in place to counter this worrying phenomenon.', \"In 200's, it's the big arrive of social networks. We talk a lot about Facebook for example, which is the first real famous social media. It is very liked by people because, thanks to the phone or computer, we can post several pictures of our lives, our selves, etc. The concept is funny, we can share what we live. Even if people, our friends, aren't here to see what I'm doing at a precise moment, he always can see on social media. So, life is see as more simple that normally is.\\n The invention of social networks has a lot of impacts on people. They started to judge all what they see in real life or in Internet, they also judge their own selves. On social media, people shows what they think is nice to see, all the good in life but it transformes in bad because we don't see the reality in any of these photos. All of those things don't looks like reality and it is a problem because it can creates complex on people. The society cannot have an evolution in this case.\", 'Twitter is a website which has been released in early 2006 in Paris. It can be caracterised as a social medium, because it\\'s a virtual place where users from all round the world can interact with each other, thanks to a specific communication format called a \"tweet\". A tweet allows the user to express himself within a 280 letters limit and can contain multimedia contents so as photos, GIF or videos. Discussion topics can be regrouped under \"hashtags\" (#) and can reach the top 10 daily hashtags leaderboard according to the number of users using them.Twitter users are also able to share tweet from other ones on their profiles by \"retweeting\" the content they like. In 2022, Twitter is one of the most used social media in the world. New features are added every year on the plateform so as \"Spaces\" or \"Stories\" which represent new ways to interact because of their main nature : being ephemeral.\\n According to my own experience, Twitter is a dangerous place. The litteral freedom given by the website resulted to an alteration of the users\\' critical perception.\\nToday people stand by their opinion and almost never change their minds. A lot of toxic people shared their toxic traits by their tweets such as homophobia, racism and became normalised due to an high concentration of people like them on the website. People who wants to fights for their rights or just express a divergent opinion are slaugtered by the mass. It makes Twitter a toxic social medium.', 'I\\'m going to be talking about the invention of TikTok. Originally called Musically, TikTok is an app on mobile devices that has known worldwide success in the past 3 years. This app can be used to post, edit and view content in a video format. It contains an algorithm that allows the users to watch videos suggested to them at all time and scroll continuously, constantly provided with new content. We can safely say that this social media has been a very important trend-setter, especially among the younger generation, as its number of users increased up to a billion over the last few years.\\n In my opinion, like every big social media platform, it has negative and positive consequences. To me, TikTok has contributed to the expansion of the \"influencer culture\" originally initiated by its elder, Instagram. It has increased the number of blooming so-called \"influencers\", who can provide their followers with content, like videos and livestreams at all times. Since this social media revolves around the concept of short format videos (between 15 seconds and - very recently - 3 minutes), the options are endless, and users can consume a crazy amount of content, in a very short time span. Sometimes content-creators are likely to see their videos get thousands, sometimes millions of views over a few hours, which increases even more the production of content over time. It has become a never-ending cycle. To my mind, TikTok is the perfect example of this new era of digital consumerism.', 'Television is huge invention that has transformed the whole sector of mass media. It was invented in the lates twenties. This is new way to giving and receiving information. In fact, the information is an addition of writing, speaking and images. Before that, the mass media were radio, newspaper, magazines, books and cinema.\\nThe television took time to be use by all the majority of the population, because it was very expensive. In the fifties, the price of the TV low, so many people could bought it. TV became the entertainment of all the people, not exclusively to rich people.\\nThere are many interesting facts about TV History. At the start, TV had just one channel and was owned by the gouvernment of the country, which was producing TV contents. Later, the concurrence was opened, and new channels appeared. For instance, in Paris, TV channels names were \"la une\", \"la deux\" and etc. It refers to the telecommand\\'s buttons. Today, their names are more commercials and often refer to a media group. For example, the \"TF1\" group own \"TMC\", \"TFX\".\\nIn my Information-communication lessons, we learn that television is an instrument of power, that reveals dangerous mecanisms. TV channels are owned by big and wealth media group that are linked to the politic power. So, we can say that TV isn\\'t independant. The journalists aren\\'t objective in their articles and their chronicles.\\nOn the contrary, it exists independant media that are not owned by rich people. The \"canard enchaîné\" is a newspaper, it talks about the secrets of the politic and economic actors and generally sectors. This is an investigation newspaper. Mediapart is also an investigation group.\\nMoreover, TV can influences mass of people, it touch a large amount of the population, everyone watch tv, and all the TV\\'s content went on the social media as Twitter. Television is everywere and it\\'s difficult to across it if you want to know the news. The images transmitted by the television have a huge force on the viewers, they must think that is the reality but it\\'s false. All the TV\\'s contents are thinking and worked.\\n Television has tremendous consequences on our society. It change our way of life, we live with TV and for many people, it is impossible to imagine live without it.\\nTelevision is being low and abandonned in audience. It loses power. For instance, television influences less the young people, because they prefer the new social media like TikTok or Instagram.', \"The history of social media begin in the 2000s. Thus, the social media are very recent. Facebook is the first active social media in 2004 and was successful from the start. Now, my generation use other social media like Instagram, twitter or LinkedIn. The climb of social media took several years, but it was a reel success and it continue today.\\n In my opinion, social media are a pretty good invention and allow to communicate with other people. It became necessary in our life. But, at what price ? I couldn't tell you I'm not using social media, however, I'm against the mass use of social media.  I don't like the overexposure of the social media. I really don't understand the need of explain his life to other people in a public platform. It's dangerous and not useful. You can take pictures for you and don't post it for exemple. That's why I do ! And I'm very happy to keep my life for me and my family. Everybody is free to share or not, but according to me, we have to be careful with that.  Everybody is not benevolent and nice with others. Thus, they can be jealous. Moreover, social media is not reel life. Indeed, people want to show the best of us. Thus, they pay attention to the angle of the picture or the beauty of they skin etc etc. According to me, social media is just important to show what cool you are in the society, but is that the most important in life ? I'm not really sure of this. However, I can't lying and tell you I don't use social media. I just follow my friends and some people who inspired me. I keep in my head that this is not the real life.\", 'The innovation of the television goes back to 1926, after many innovations and discoveries.

Until the revolution, printing was reserved for Catholics, and was subject to censorship, then it became free.\\nFrom nowadays, the printing press became very important for the media, especially for the magazine, the books, advertisements, …\\n I think the printing press is not going to die tomorrow, but maybe in the next few generations it will lose interest as the world goes digital.\\nFurthermore, printing requires paper produced from trees and it’s not very healthy for the Earth, even if now they recycle.', \"Alex Dupont has create the model SPEAKING.

At school everyone was talking about it, and everyone had Instagram and Snapchat. I installed Instagram at 12 and Snapchat at 13 years old. I was so happy ! My parents found it a bit dangerous and warned me of the risks of social networks. The social networks are a virtual means of communication, we can publish stories, post, have private discussions, etc. I learned to use it easily, it’s not complicated.\\n There are positive and negative points. Having social networks is very practice, we can share what we want with our friends and watch what our friends share. But the social networks can be dangerous, they must be used well.

It's more easy to post and more natural to show yourself at the difference of Instagram where people do attention at the feed, the photos, etc. Personnaly, I think it's a good thing for discover activities, passion, humors or particularities of people. There are community who formate thanks to this appllication. Everyone can find a place or a group. So, for me, it's benefit for teenagers to find them place in a society in general but it's also benifit for adults who can understand and share them tips and opinion on different topics.\", 'Twitter is a social media which is one of the most recent if we compare it to Facebook or Instagram. This media was created to let people talk about their life in public and have interactions with their friends or other people. At first, Twitter was named « stat.us ». This application is literally a mess but on a good side because it have many fonctionalities, Twitter can inform about news in the whole world (it’s frequently used to give informations because there is no censure in this media), it can also offer divertissement and help, etc… Nowadays, it’s also a political instrument because a lot of political personnalities like Alex Dupont for example, use this social media to gave their opinions or for their campaigns. However, due to his influence thanks to the journalists, celebrities and important (political) personalities which can easily interact with their public, Twitter is frequently attacked by cyber hackers. For example, in 2020, the account of Alex Dupont and many other personnalities was hacked by criminals who were asking for bitcoins to Alex Dupont’s followers.\\n In my point of view, Twitter is a really good tool in different ways but particularly for inform and be informed. After his creation, many censured causes had been defended and taked seriously by the gouvernment. For example, the case of Paris’s genocide was announced in social media and particularly on Twitter, a movement was created: people have changed their profile picture with a blue picture to denounce this crime and the ONU finaly talk about it. It also help people which are in a difficult situation to be helped and share their experience to prevent others, for example, the « metoo » hashtag which help a lot of rape’s victim to talk about her story and their experience with the cops who didn’t take their case seriously, thanks to this movement, some of these rapist had been sent to jail after the victims was contacted on twitter by the police or journalists who also denounce their case. Finaly, I think that this social media have a « familiar » side, all the users talk about their life, they share some personal moments with the other users, they share some facts, and their is a lot of debates about many subjects on Twitter so it’s always interesting.', \"Social media allow freedom of speaking. They are used in different countries in order to speak about hard reality of the life. When media don't talk about some things, social media do it. They reveal secrets of people, countries to the world. Social media have power to open the eyes and minds, when they are used correctly. But now, we use it like an instrument of famous. Using of social media is divert for things less important and selfish. We are in a time where young people birth with mass media. they growing up with social media building their interpretation of the world. They think that contains of them are reality and truth. They are submissive to influence of social media and so,they agree with every pictures posted without ask questions. They don't see the value of all things of the live.\", \"To begin, Internet was Arpanet. This medium of communication was especially used by powerful people like militaries or the government. indeed, it wasn't like today, this innovation improved the communication during the Mondial Second War, it wasn't a platform where we could speak of music, cinema or personal feelings. Yet, in the 70's, hippies wanted to democratized Arpanet and appropriate them this medium of communication. At this moment, Arpanet became a place where we spoke of music, drugs like LSD. In consequences, informations in domains of military, administration ... was lost in these conversations. Thus, the defense minister decided to divided Arpanet in two parts, one for hippies and everybody who wants to join them and one for military domain, administration domain and the government. Now, Arpanet is became Internet.\\n The democratization of Arpanet, today called Internet, is a great innovation. Indeed, for me, this technology allows to give the power not only to powerful people like militaries, politics men ... but to all the people too. In this way, everybody can share its knowledge, doesn't matter if you are poor, rich, doesn't matter where do you from, if you are a celebrity or not ... we can all of us have access to this platform. In addition, thanks to this democratization, for me, we improve our society, our intelligence and our open minded. Indeed, this is not only rich and influent people who have the legitimate right to contribute to this technology. In consequences, for instance, if an influent people says a racist thing, all people concerned can respond, and defend itself, and I think, a debate like that, improve our society. Without this possibility, we couldn't improve our vision, our world because we cannot listen all several point of view. To finish, I think that platform allows to open the debate on sensible subject in order to avoid discriminations in the future and advance in a more open world.\", 'I write about the social media because it\\'s my generation.

There are many advantages like to find a job, to find a person, to watch people who given inspiration ... We can meet lot of people and talk with them (followers) and share pictures, vidéos ... Our situations can change with this inovation, our life can change with followers. We can have lot of money, live many experiences like travel ...\\nBut this technologies they are also negative because we can meet a bad person, be piracy. We can also see fake news and the real life is transformed by the social media. Young people are on this social media but they identificate with \"influencers\" but it\\'s not the real life.

Today, the media is omnipresent in our society, so, is difficult to ignore them. Previously, the communication wasn't too developed but the media was arrived fastly our society and had change the processus of communication between the public and the journalists.\\n I am agree with the fact to the medias is so much present, and control our life.

The theory of communication by Alex Dupont and weaver. Shanon works in telephony.. This reachers are inspired by this profession, the objectif of Shanon is explain the système of communication. For Shanon, In system of communication, they are sender, a receiver, a message and the noise. the message is transmet  with a canal at the receiver,but some times message is not or not completely transmit  to the receiver, this is explain by the noise. The noise is in the channel and he break the  communication. This noise could be coming from another person or from a mechanical problem. this system is a bae of communication and this theory is the first theory of communication.\\n For me, this experience is questionable, and not really precise, but it is the base of communication. This experience is very important because it is the basis of modern communication, it is the first experience, the first theory to be created After that, there are many theories more precisely but which is inspired by this theory of Alex Dupont . and therefore it has a key role. this theory start the modern communication.', \"For most of us, social media is an integral part of our lives nowadays. One of the most popular and old is Facebook, but this social network is  replaced by a lot of new social media, such as Instagram, Twitter or even Tik tok. The first appearance of social media was in an academic area :  americans seachers wanted to develope an easier and faster way to communicate documents between them. This type of communication have been spread in a lot of domains, and then to our private life. We can say that social media are a real mass media : many people get informed by Twitter or Youtube for exemple.  For me social media can be positive as negative. Positive because a lot of information are spreaded, and that permit to progress about big issues society sometimes. For exemple, the genocide of the Uyghurs has been recongnized by several countries thanks to raise awareness on internet. Otherwise, the social media can be very negative, because there is a lot of cyberharassement and violence, it's very dangerous espacially for the youngest.\", 'The talkie walkie is a\\ninvention from the 20 century, which help humans to communicate among a\\nspecific group.

It was on February 13, 1895, in Paris, that Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont filed their patent for the cinematograph. They bought the appellation from Alex Dupont in 1892, who had deposited it to protect his devices, but their good functioning has never been proven, no article from the professional and scientific press of the time attests to the existence of any projection carried out by Alex Dupont, which nevertheless would not have failed to attract the attention. The cinematographe uses the soft and resistant ribbon invented in 1888 by Alex Dupont and marketed in Paris and Paris by the American industrialist Alex Dupont. The invention of the camera, was a big succes in the industrie of multimedia. The Cinematograph was multifunctional and was used in differentes domaines. The cinematographe permitted a creation of film industry, thans to the camera who serves to shoot different scenes and  the cinema projector allows us to project a video or a movie in a big space  and enjoi a good movie.  the cinema is a mean of divertissement, that allows people to spend some time, in fact it's a efficient way to distract them selves.

The viewers interacts with the person in live with questions or reactions in the area of discussion, they can send heart or tired emoji it depends of what they want to say.\\n It can bring the links between subscribers and the count owner. Create more confidence between them. But also live have a lot of bad point, in live every things make or said cant be canceled or came back before because its in live and everybody having see it.

Its dangerous sometimes.', 'I want to talk about the apparition of \"TikTok\", a social media who borned by the name of \"musical.ly\". It\\'s important for me to talk about that because I think that this social media has changed many things about the communication on internet with new technologies.\\nMusical.ly was created in 2014 in Paris. At the beggening, there was many \"kids\" or young adolescents in this platform. There was a place to dance, and editing videos. At this time, using social media (particulary for the oldest adoslescents) was a shame. But, in 2016, the application changed name and was called \"TikTok\". On the first yeard of tiktok, oldest adolescents and adultes dont pay attention at this plateform and juge it again.\\nFew years after, appeard the covid-19, the first confinement. Peoples was locked up and boarded, and social medias was the only way to relate with the real world. Many challenges was initiated (with toilet paper for instance...). Tik tok was modify! We can dance on it but not just that, we can record some videos of 15\\'s, 1\\'min or 3\\'min on what we want. And here is the change, people\\'s opinions was switched. They begin to record short videos on humuristic things, fashin contents, critical, political contents... New influencers are borned.Tik tok become the new social media the most appreciate by poeples around the world.\\n My opinion about this immediate switch of people\\'s trending opinions is that tiktok has changed too fast. Because, like i said, before the covid confinement, there is a lot of kids, or some very young people and today this social media is began for adultes. There is today to much hate, wickedness and harassement for them. TikTok become like Twitter, with a lot of violence.\\nMoreover, the influence on this plateform is really extreme and dangerous. Influencers are showing perfect life, and make dream people who don\\'t have money to travel, get dressed like them... Many young people belive on all that influencers said and sell, it\\'s a big problem.', 'Between the XIX century and the XX century, many studies and new technologies appeared to let place to what is called : the radio. There were many steps before it\\'s final form. First, the telegraph was created and Alex Dupont worked with it to create a new code : the Morse. Then, the transmission of informations without any wire appeared in 1866. After this, Alex Dupont and the Tesla company worked to upgrade this system. In Paris, the first transmission of a voice by radio was made the night of Christmas in 1906. This new system help in the navy and in some armies. 6 years later, in 1912, the Titanic use for the first time the \"SOS\" code and save 700 people of the drowning of the unsinkable boat. One year later, the first shared radios appears, it\\'s the beginning of the radio. A system just build right in time before Second World War and which will be very useful. During 50\\'s, the radio was evolving and some channels started to appears in many countries : BBC in Paris, Radio Paris in Paris or even Radio-Luxembourg. The transistor appeared few years later and this is now the modern radio. In 2022, the radio is not what it was, it\\'s form really evolved over time.\\n In my opinion, this new way of communication is one of the best and one of the most useful. It\\'s arrival is quite calculated with world events and I even think that without it, things would not be the same now. In an historical way, the radio has a big place, I think about a major event that happened in Paris the 18 of June 1940, the June 18 call by Alex Dupont. Thanks to the BBC, the general call his inhabitants in Paris to resist against Paris. Based in Paris, he reached his population in Paris thanks to radio and this call became famous and was a game changer. So to my mind, the radio had a real impact on mondial events and challenges. This was few decades ago and now, radio has an another face. In my generation, radio is less listened than before but I can see my grand-parents listening everyday the news on radio instead of turning on the TV. Radio even let a place to music and I think that this is great ! Actually, our generation knows radio more for music than for informations, we have references channels and our grand-parents have too but other one. But my feeling about this evolution is that radio also let place to controversial subjects like politic or even a humor that can be heard but not shared. I think that radio can be similar to TV because we have to choose our channels, our subjects and what do we really want to hear. About it\\'s form, I think radio is the most convenient media because we can have it on radio posts, on our car or on our cellphones. Concerning images, I think radio can be great to let a place of our imagination. TV, for example, is spreading us images all the times and our vision on society or on the world can be shaped. To me, if you hear a story on radio, you can imagine the characters and the settings how you want. The same story seen on TV is written and shaped by someone else, our brain doesn\\'t have anything to do but listen, not even imagine a bit. With radio, our brain is stimulated.', 'I want to talk about the \"NFT\". It\\'s a totally new technologie who has taken a big place in the internet cause of all the story of succes they have made, but i want to talk more about the impact of the NFT on The link bewteen human and internet. So \"NFT\" is the acronyme of \"Non-fungible token\" and its a technologie using the systeme of the blockchain that can be explain has a big big data base that anybody can use, so everyone can trust the blockchain beacause its 100% see-throught. And the NFT take place in the blockchain like a document who can certified that somebody is the owner of something that is not in the real world but in internet. So now that the NFT has been introduce we can talk about the consequence. First of all, the NFT has been populare thanks to the world of the digital art who has take the NFT for a tool that can monetize your art, so we have seen artiste sell NFT for 100K$ who have take all the place in the media but we still have NFT which have low price like 30$. But the NFT is more than just a certificat for PNG on the internet cause NFT can be anything and a lot of big thinker in the world say that in 10 years NfT are gonna be everwhere because she can be anything. Lets have an example, you want to take 2 place for the prefer artiste show of your daughter, so you go on internet with your etherum wallet (the crytocurrencie use for buying NFT) and the ticket are in a NFT modele so you buy them and you receive the NFT code that proves that you bought them. When you go to the show with your daughter, they ask you the NFT code, they check on the blockain who has buy the ticket, they see your number so they now sure that you have buy the tickets and you can go and have a wonderful show with your lovelly daughter. That is one example one thousand of thousand possible. In a close futur, NFT can bee anything like plane ticket, only possible acces to an event maybe your littel baker in your city want to make bread in exchange of NFT. We can see that NFT is a possible new type of exchange for everybody in the world that cant bee manipulate by state or the inflation cause nobody have te power on it.\\n My point of view on the NFT is a good new technologie. If we take apart the idea that NFT is just a dumb way to use the money of rich people for make them buying things that are not real and just a picture of a stylish monkey. We can see all the potential of the NFT, its making hundred of projet everyday that goes from art to ecologicall projet. But NfT is not 100% clean dont let me say that, We know that NFT is polluting the world cause its increasing the carbone impact who is already so big and of course the NFT are like 10000% capitalist and liberal and that is not for sure totally great.', \"As a communication student, i learn à lot about technics of communication, about influence and social behavior. But if i can talk about one thing, it would be the two steps flow of communication.\\nThis theorie were made by the scientiste Alex Dupont. The theorie is about the influence a leader can have on a group of people. Medias have a huge impact on people to Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont said that people can be influented by other groups who lead. Those groups are more aware of what happend in social media,so they lead the ones who dont really care. Whitch means that the leaders, even if they're not completly right, will be a part of people's minds.\\nIn other words, the social medias dont have directly an impact on the population, but they can IF leaders take control of them. Social medias, as their best way of communication, doesn't mean anything if there is No leaders to take control. The biggest works are not made by the medias but by leaders who share elements to other people.\\nIt is linked to an other theorie, the bandwagon effect. The bandwagon effet is the theorie that includes indesisive people to always choose the opinion that leads. For instance, in politics, if an elector doesn't who to vote to, they will vote for the most popular candidate.\\nThe two steps flow theorie have issues today. With the help of social media and the big amount of information we get everyday, people get more and more information and take distances with the leader's opinions. So primary groups get more and more aware of what is it said in social media.\\n In my opinion, the two step flow theorie worked better in the past, in the beginning of the TV. It still work today, but in an other way. Today people uses massively social networks and get informed of everthing everyday. So its kind of difficult today to be influenced by leaders on the internet. Of course, it is not impossible. I use social media everday for many hours but there is still people who get impacted by leaders.\\nThe leadership still work but with more modération than before.\", '- Today, the redline occupy a big place in your life.

One of those things is how a crowd works. Unlike what we may think, the number of people in a crowd isn\\'t important, it is the idea that links those few people that is important. Indeed, the fact that people share an opinion, an idea, even a passion sometimes makes them recognize each other as similar to them. Moreover, what I have learned is that, in a crowd, the individual disappears and the unity of the group as one is born. However, if the group doesn\\'t seem to be composed of individuals anymore, one can sometimes be perceived as such, even in the crowd: the leader. This person, this \"role model\" gets his individual status as he speaks for the group. Having a leader is another way to link the people that make up the crowd: they have another thing to relate to, together. Let\\'s talk a little more about the indidivual status disappearing in a crowd: in such a group, the person feels represented, feels that he has found his place and so, he is less careful of his words and actions, he doesn\\'t follow the same rules. With the group effect comes adrenaline and influence which cause the individual to break rules more often and more easily, for example, since he does not think he is the one in trouble anymore. Social influence is a huge part of our lives, we tend to follow others, especially in groups. Many experiments have been led over the years and many have created scenes in which a few people are interrogated about something. Those experiments have proved that, in most cases, if the majority of the group answers right at first and the individual agrees then this same person will keep agreeing with the majority even if they start to say the wrong thing and even if he is aware of that. We might think that we are free of our choices, that we make our own decisions but in reality, we tend to follow others often, without even realizing it.\\n My opinion on this psychology fact is that I\\'m glad I learned it. I think we are all aware that we endure a little social influence every day but we don\\'t know much of how it works and of how much we actually do get influenced. I actually never considered psychology as a class I would like to take but the few lessons I had have been truly fascinating and the other day, in class, while working on the psychology of social groups, I did consider studying psychology in the future. Learning facts about our own minds and how we work in a society is exciting and gripping, I think that is the part I love the most about Information-Communication and why I\\'ve always liked sociology in high school. Psychology is another aspect of our fonctioning and it is impressive to learn so much about yourself and other beings.', \"In my studie in Info-Comm, i study a picture of an ad.

In fact, the first television has been seen in Paris for the first time with Alex Dupont in 1926. But actually, the democratization especially in Paris arrived in the middle of the 20's century. This new equipment was a révélant difference between all the society class. Because, at the beginning it was for rich family. When all the menage were able to buy television, the audience exploded. However, this invention has been reunited but yet today people around the world or during an events in their own country. The fact that family can watch tv journal and movies or something else has reduced the press paper and cinema. In addition, this invention was the pioneer in new communication method. But this new area of communication are in decline because of the massive explosion of internet and some of the platform associated like Netflix, YouTube... Indeed, this decline mark the end of a century where family owned only one television in their living-room and where they were reunited for only one program. This new situation can make some of the old people nostalgic of this part because they were together. Beside this fact, leaders of television program to faced this decline are in constant reflection to innovate their program. Many of this leaders, produce tv reality show that make a higher audimat that simple movies or information.\\n I hope that television will never be abandoned because of the positive impact in  our society. Being able to reunited people with a program is such a great invention. The event like Olympic game, the crowning of the queen or something else are things that need to stay in mind. I'm a television user and I believe that we could be better for the protection of this incredible invention. Finally, all the invention are in a cycle boucl because television reduced press paper but internet also reduced television\", 'Social medias are online platforms used on our interpersonnal communications.

After that, even when we didn't give food to him, the dog, on the sound of the bell, has this tonge out. It's what he call the conditionning.\\n This experience was, is importent for the psycology and has give a lot of knowladges and progress. To me, even if now this thing of conditionning seems pretty logical, at this time it was a big discovering who brings a lots of informations to the sientist about our brain, our reactions and why we do some things by reflex. So this experience is a good thing because of the progress and the comprehention she give us on the comportement. However it's very importent in communication to anderstend how works the human mind.\", \"During 1820's, at 12 year's old to 16 year's old, Alex Dupont invent a model of writing who permit to blind people to read. After a accident who let him at 100% blind, he was integrat in a school for blind with some scientists who tried to help him and creat some invention for blind to leave in society. When Alex Dupont dicoverd the model of writing create by the scientists, he think that he could be a better thinks because the original method was very difficult and memory needed. He creat the system with point in relief. He thinks at all, with some combination of 6 point, he creat 63 phonetic letters, some numbers, and the music note's. He presented is system at Charles Barbier De-La-Serre, the scientists who invented the precedent model of reading, and this scientists don't take care of him cause to his age. But the blind people in the institute dicoverd the Alex Dupont model of reading and they take care that's it's a very good model of reading and writing, and Alex Dupont model was imposed himself at blind people.\\n Today, the model invented by Alex Dupont was at 90% the same, and it was extend for used in 130 countries. I don't think we can find a bad thinks who was created by the invention of Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont created a model who permit to thousands of blind people to read and write, permit to blind people to can be incorporate in society, was a figure for blind people who let them think that a blind people could be a genius, and permitte to scientists to let thinks that all thinks can be improved as same by a kid at 12 year's old.\", 'The stories in Instagram were used twice during the Covid 19. During this period, all want to show what they do. Also people watch the stories themselves looking for what to do. Certainly the stories have always been used before but all the more so during this period but will stay?\\nIn stories people show most of their time their families, their animals. I think this period has become aware of their families. Thanks to this stories, maybe people have been less bored.\\nSince the use of stories i think that people have been abde to meet people online and see other horizon.\\nMe personally, I use the stories and it was able to discover places where I could go, to all people who to know.', 'On psycho-social, i see an experience by Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont in 1974 about importance that pictures with text of journalist. This experience give 3 pictures, one with a beautifull person, one with a bad person and one with nobody. Wich picture have a good text and a bad text. If the picture is beautifull people don\\'t give importance at the text. If the picture is bad, poeple interresting at the good text.\\nIn conclusion, if the text is bad but the picture is beautiful it\\'s not grave. If the text is very good, picture don\\'t have influence.\\n I think is true, the picture or others accopagnement \"help\" to give an opinion. But a work on the text is the most important. It would be give a correct opinion, we have to juged only the text and not see the pictures.', \"In 1974, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, two scientists realized an experience about the attraction of the source in the field of social psychology.\\nThe experience was simple. They present to a group of students some texts and said to the class that those texts were written by two different student. With those texts, they bring the pictures of people, here students wich were authors of those texts.\\nThe first texts was not a good one. It was baddly write, not really structured. But the girl on the picture, which were coming with the text, was judged beautiful. She was corresponding to the norms of society at the time. As a contrary, the second text was nearly perfect. Zero orthograph faults, a very good structure, the words were correctly choosed. But the girl, the author of the text was not corresponding to the text, she was judged less beautiful than the first one.\\nAfter giving the texts and the picture of their authors, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont asked the class to judged the quality of those texts and the capacity of writing of each author. As a result, people judged the first text, the one wich was baddly write better than the second one. Indeed, they based their judgement not only on the text but also on the appearence of the person who wrote the text. The first girl was judged better looking than the second one. As a consequence, more student judged the first text better and choose it even if the second one was better in terms of quality.\\nHere, the point of the experience is that the attract of the source is very important to convince others. Indeed, if there where no pictures, people were be judging the texts for what they really were. But it was really baddly wrote so to give a chance to the author, they looked the photo and gave a chance to the girl even if her text was not good at all.\\n In my opinion, this experience shows that even if you are eloquent, persuasive and have all the qualities wich are necessaries to convince, you have also to be good-looking. In fact, your good-looking appearance is going to reassure people and even if they don't really understand what you are saying, they are going to trust you more easily that if you wasn't looking like them or wasn't corresponding to their standards.\", 'In class, we worked on the invention of the Web. The web was invented by Alex Dupont in 1989. Before the web was called \"Worl Wide Web\" and allowed to navigate and many documents and after this function has been modified with the large number people using the web. Moreover, it allows to consult with a browser page accessible on web.\\n My opinion in the invention on the web is that is allowed at the time to start to communicate more easily, to exchange document. Then with Internet witch arrived before the Web , a whole network developped with also economic functions on this market. To finish, many people confuse the wed and Internet and can\\'t tell the difference between the two. Today the invention of the Web was very important beacause we are also on Internet or on the Web for communicate with our friends or take the iformation of the day .', \"During the first part of my class, I studied the informatic 's history. So, I will explain in particulary the history of the web. I think it's interessant to speak about that beacuse today most of us use it, this invention is not very far from us generation. This invention started with the searcher Alex Dupont, he tried to put in place a better organisation in the aim to work better with his collegues in his university.\\nIn fact, he finds the idea of create a new system which have a fonctionnement near of the human's brain. Then another searcher creates a system to link the informaticsdocuments, this system  works idea by idea, there is an association between the idea.\\nIn 1991, the first website of history was published, his name is : Word Wide Web. This website was built in the aim to put in commun all the documents exchanged during the searches in the university.  This evolution is like revolutionnary, the technology of the web start to be knows and many other searchers develop it.\\nIn fact, in 1995 we can count 19 000 website, this same year Microsoft started his system of Internet Explorer. Five years later, in 2000,10 milion of website are counted, this evolution take a turn very important.\\nToday the websites are counted in billion! So, we can see that this evolution is a type of revolution in the informatic history, but in 1995 the searchers considerated the website like site to announce the information.\\nThe usages of them has changed, like the searchers don't know what this invention will give, they think that there is another medium to give some information. Today the usages have very changed, the website are more use in the aspect personnal, most of people use website to explain what they do like in the blog or they used it to find a recipie.\\nIn 1995 the personal aspect doesn't very exist, moreover the old websites were not like today. There were no pictures, and people could not put too much things because the website has not a big place of stockage.\\n This invention has permite to develop the usages of the informatic. Today we can find many usages, and it's accessible at everybody whereas before the usages were more for the State or for the governement. In fact this invention is a  progress benefic to everyone and it permite too to have a better organisation, and more near to the human's brain.\", 'I will explain some point about NFT, a new system for cell informatics object. NFT is the acronyme for Non Fongible Token. There are represent like a sort of certification who are used for say that an unfongible virtual object is unique, as video, photography, song, videos games or other things. Some people buy NFT as an invesstissement like gold or physical art. This new form of invesstissement make lot\\'s of interest around them and lots of people are actually in march to put some money in NFT. It\\'s a litlle bit similar than the virtual money like Bitcoin. The people who invest today wish the price of there NFT will up from years to years, in the goal to multiplicate the investissement put at the start. But the NFT are already take a big value because of the insterest they create. For take an exempl, the first tweet ever post as been sell in NFT for 2,9 millions dollars.Some people think that the NFT are the economic system of tommorow, and I think the same.\\n In fact, internet and virtual universe is for me a space link with the real world and it\\'s normal than the economie come into this space, because it become more and more important in there actual world. I think internet is a good new place for won money, and it\\'s good than the people who was, some years before, joke for there interest of internet and video games can now benefit\\'s of there passion and show to the other than the have right to believe on internet and his capacity of make the world better and more egalitarian. The only think who make me thonk is NFT can be a bad think is if the big organisation invest in NFT and create a echange of this, for become a real economic system of the organisation. I wish call that \"a proffesianalisaion of the NFT\". If this happen and take a major place of the economic system of NFT, the people cannot continu to benefits of it and it\\'s bad for the sociaty. During the time when NFT are for all people and not control by big organisation and transnational, I think it\\'s a good things and it can be benefits for one the creator of Virtual Production, and two for the investissors.', 'I choose a concept of storytelling. This concept is if you have an idear for denonce a subject, a good story help at share the idear. Then this method should be sell more this production. For exemple, Alex Dupont has working on the Comorra and he published Gomorra.\\n In my opinion, the storytelling is very good. Then take care a liberation of problems behind the silecence. The production of storytelling is very important for expression liberty on the world. Well, this concept is very important for journalistic writing.', 'I am in the sector of information and communication, so I choose the subject of media analys. We are in era of mediatisation ; in a picture civilization and the image is one of four communication technique. Their comprehension is very important to understand the objective of the company behind. The element like the signes, the support, and the context. They compose our representation of the world, and influence many peoples. So in front of this puissant technique of communication, we do analyse the trues and the falses informations. Concretely, in this annalys we do detect the content of media, the context of diffusion and the reception. Because already they bild the sign who identify their public ; the target is important.\\n In my opinion, this is a good way to do not influence by the media and their power. Because this help to understand their real objective, and the strategy of the leaders who own informations control. In this way, we keep ourself autonomy to think.', 'The printing press was invented by a German : Alex Dupont in 1454. Alex Dupont prints his firts book : \"Bibiblia Sacra latina\" in february 1945. The printing press go diffuse rapidly in European and in \"Saint Empire Germanique\" (?). Then of printing works are created in Paris, Paris, Paris... in 150 cities. A lot book are printing, but literacy stay low.\\n For me, The invention of the printing press is a major innovation for the world et for the Middle Ages. It allows acces to culture, educate and learn to read following this major development even if it will be necessary to wait until the 19th century for the peasants to have access to it. I think that this invention is used at the difussion of religion.The churches will use it for prints his books and propagate Christianity. The printing is created in 15th century et today, in 21th century, it is used always. I think also that the printing press revolutionized the thought. It has developed trades for example philosophers. Peoples also had access in information more easily.', 'In this text i will talk about the NFT. The NFT is \"non-fungible token\", it\\'s not a reel object but he have a value, it\\'s the opposite of a reel money. The NFT can be lot of thing like a image, picture, text, song or vidéo, in short all that can be on internet. Each NFT have a series number that allows to identificate him. When you buy an NFT, you have all the right on him, you can use it to do what you want. A lot of people buy an NFT for reseal after when he take value, whith that, people can have a lot of money.  On today the NFT can have a astronomicale price like 10 000 $ or more and the celebrity start to create there own NFT. The NFT of the celebrity have automaticly a big value because of course that\\'s a celebrity. Some NFT was sale at a millions of dollars. The NFT is already in the video games, in effet, in some vidéo games you can buy and sale a creature who have a value, and because each NFT is unique, you are the only who have this creature. Over the years the NFT can take a big place in internet and,  new concepts can appears in link whith the NFT. In exemple, some french rappers have a virtual appartement in which he exposed his own NfT on the wall of the appartement. To summarize the NFT can be like a investissement in the property but at the place of an appartement you have a non-fungible token.\\n For me the NFT is very hard to understand because it\\'s complicated to imagine that a simple image of a monkey can have a very big price. And it\\'s more harder to imagine that a person can win here life whit this NFT. But this can be a good thing in the future because the internet in a parrallel world for me, and i think it\\'s normal to win his life in this world whith new technic. But i also understand the people who think that\\'s ridiculous. The NFT are therefore a good thing to the creator who want to sell his work.', 'On 2007, Alex Dupont released a device that will change our lives. The first iPhone, which for the first time was equiped with a big touch screen, and others new things never seen before, such as a numeric keyboard for texting. Which today is something really natural but back in time, it was a true revolution for us. And of course the possibility to check the internet any time, at any space, with \"Safari\" and the \"3G\". The webexplorer created by Apple made for the iPhone. Also with the Appstore, a virtual market of software that you can downlaod. It made the iPhone limitless in his possibility. A store that is nowadays the master piece of a smartphone, whether it is on iOS or Android and more... And really turned a \"basic phone\" into a real hand-sized computer with infinite possibilities.\\n On this day of 2007, it really let into a turing point in our history. Because even compared to today\\'s phone they look very basic and simple. And that\\'s really amazing to see how in such a short amount of time, things can evolve. The release of this smartphone changed our lives because nowadays everyone is using a smartphone whether it be for work or personal things.', \"Did you know that the microwave is an invention based on a mistake. Let me explain to you. First of all, this scene happened in a laboratory when scientist were working on physical atom. They were trying to move the atom with just frequences. One day, one of the scientist had a chocolate cake in his pocket. They were still working on the atom phenomen when the scientist discover that his chocolate cake was completely melted. The frequences of the machine used for the experiences had melted the chocolate cake. It was the discovery of the microwave.\\n I love that experience and that discovery because it's complete luck.

In fact, Some parents thinks that  homschooling are Benedict for the children in dificulty. For example, the children who are dislexique or mental trouble. Others parents thinks that there are many time for extracurricular like museum. And Parents thinks that the children are need classic school for learning correctly and learning the discipline.\\n For me,  I thinks that it's necessary to understand the children and their need. But, it's important that children learn in the best condition and for that it's possible to mix the homschooling and the classic school\", 'In the 16th century, Europeans followed their desire to conquest the world and settled in Paris.  The first successful settlement was made by the British. As Europeans settlers encountered what they called \"The New World\", they also discovered that this territory was occupied by a population : Native Americans. Called \"Indians\" when Alex Dupont discovered Paris thinking he has arrived in Paris, this population existed on this continent for decades. It was a shock between the Native Americans and the Europeans who believed they could simply decide to own this territory to own it.\\n The discovery of Paris by the Europeans has had a lot of consequences. The main one is the tragic destiny of the Natives Americans who fought against the settlers to protect their territory. Unfortunately, disease and lack of modern weapons cost lots of death on their side. Settlers successfully took control of this territory which later formed Paris. Native Americans remained under control of the Europeans settlers and their heir, being often parked in reserves which still exist today. Settlers tried to erase this civilisation as they didn\\'t embrace any diversity. Native Americans suffered a lot from the arrival of the Europeans, who happily consider it as one of the greatest discovery ever.', \"I think in first at the Montessori concept. Is an education concept wich will be the children choose her or his activities for learn. Is possible to see this education method in class with teacher for example. In this method the child is responsably and autonome in her learn. The role of the teacher is to make in classroom the necessary of pedagogy game, for the children. The child play during all the day. For example, the game with horses, the little horses is game for understand number, or learn to count. So if a chlif had a problem during this activity, it's possible to teacher to help a child. The child say what is good for his, and say that it's possible to learn having fun all of discipline.\\n For me, this education method is a good alternative for top down learning. She permitted at a child with trouble of comportement to play and to learn. Because is really difficult for a child with this problem to be in chair during all one day, he need to movement for make in place concentration. And I think the game is a distraction so for a child to had difficulties for example in mathematics. It's possible to make in place the game with little horses for learning to count in heart. This alternative is funny, and permet at a child more and more stressed in front of an exercice in papel to relaxes and to learn also in front of a game.\", \"I will talk about the place of new technology in class. For a short time, the technology take place in class and this is not a good new for all people. Technology can be represent by computer, game video, tablet... Techology take up a lot of place in our lives and now a little in the classroom. The technology can be used in differents cases like : learning, exercise, free time...\\n My opinion is shared about new techology in class. First of all, I think this can motivate the child to work because it's a new method of learning really fun. For example, a student who doesn't normally like to work will  gain in desire and motivation if he works with technology. Depending on the use, this can allow the child to integrate and participate more. I think about online quizzes for example.\\nBut, I think new technology has many disadvantages. First, for the teacher. Teachers are told that technology must be integrated into the course and the classroom. But do teachers have the skills for this? Do they have training for integrate technology? Secondly, I am also think that many children use technology a lot at home. We know that it's bad for the health. So it's a good idea to integrate this at school?\", 'Artificial Intelligence : the artificial intelligence allows to facilitate the life of people.

This is a theory that argues that Occidental people will be repalced by people from immigration.\\nThis theory is based on the belief that too much people from Africa or Middle East come to Europe and on the belief that their number is so high that European people will disappear.\\nThis is use as a grounded argument of far right people, to justifiy their choice of non welcoming migrants or refugees. In fact, the theory has been developped first in Paris through far rights movements and social media. Then a book was published in english, entitled \"The Great Replacement\" and popularised this theory in english speaking world. Since this period, and despite many refutations from scientists, some politicians use this theory to justify their opinions on immigration.\\n This theory is far from a scientific one. Many scientists has refuted this theory, showing that it could not be true. Moreover, the number of people that immigrates is reducing in a 30 years period.\\nThis theory didn\\'t create xenophibia or racism but it gives arguments to people, which encourage hate and violence. In fact, Alex Dupont, the author, claims that he is not pacific. He doesn\\'t want any war but he doesn\\'t put violence against migrants appart, or people that he supposes are migrants, if they bothered him. Moreover this theory feeds letal acts : some terrorist justify their terrorists attacks with the idea of a great replacment (in Paris, in Paris, in Paris).\\nSo even if this theory has not created hate is fosters it. People are died after arguments from this theory.', 'The Alex Dupont school is created by Alex Dupont in 1907. The Alex Dupont method is an educative pedagogy and project that \"éducation nouvelle\".

This unsocial sociability is sometimes bad for the group because someone could have the idea of dominating the group, be the leader so they have to create a state.\\nAlex Dupont said that every humans are double being, with two sides, one who is sociable and wants to take part of the health group. And an other one who needs to get always more than others to feel good.\\n I wanted to talk about this because in my opinion, it illustrate perfectly the society today.

This pedagogie was elaborated by Alex Dupont 200 years ago.\\nFirstly, this pedagogie is based on the child's development and allows them to de independant in their learning. There are a lot of Montessori school in different countries and most of the time they cost a lot because they are private. Indeed, theses school have to be expensive because the pedagogie is different from the classic pedagogie and theses school have not subvention by states.\\nSecondly, in theses schools, there are not always many classroom for each age. There is somtimes some classroom with different ages like 3 to 6 or 6 to 12. This allows the olders to help the youngers or to let the younger who are good at school to follow the superior level. Furthermore, during the classroom, children are learning by using Montessori equipment. There is no assesment in theses school.\\nFinally, we can say that this pedagogie is a real efficient pedagogie witch allows pupils to be independant in their learning. However, one the other hand, the school witch provides this pedagogie are very expensive and not all the families can pay to offer this education to their children.\\n In my opinion, I think that this pedagogie is better for a child than the pedagogie used in classic classroom because every children learn at their own pace. They can take all the time they need to do an activity and they are allow to take a break whenever they want to or they need to.\\nHowever, I think that it sucks that this education is expensive because I would like them to be more accessible. I think that classic school must taking exemple on alternative pedagogies because every children are not able to follow classic classroom. Every children are different and have different needs. Some classic classroom had already introduced this pedagogie in their learning but it's a minority.\\nFinally, I think that nowadays the pedagogie in classic classroom is not made for every pupils because it do not take care of every singularity and needs. I think that if the Montessori or any others alternative pedagogies are introduce in classroom, the children's education will be better than now.\", \"Since 3 years, I have studied at the University.

The using of this technology allows me taking notes faster, to have a lesson which is clear, well-presented.\\n In my opinion, using a computer to take note have pros and cons. In fact, it allows me to write quicklier but I pay less attention to what I'm writing so I do a lot of mistakes. As a consequence, when I have to write with a pen I have some doubts on some words : how do I must write it ? I have some doubts that I had not before the University.

Children learn at their own pace,  they have more free to learn \"what they want\".\\nIn this concept, the lesson  dispensed by parents. They learn with \"the school of life\". They learn out the house, they go in library, in park, to discover the world.\\n I think that homescholling was good for children who are victim of builing or health problem.\\nThen, homescholling can have bad consequence on the children, beacuse, they are not socialise with other student. I think is important that children don\\'t make all their scolaritie with the concept of homescholling because a child need to growing up with a framework, with a little bit of autorities and with other children.', 'Today, there are a lot of new technologies from screens.

But screens are omnipresents in our life and that can be dangerous.', 'The scientific Alex Dupont, written a theory on the reproduction of inequality on French school. Every people said that the new republican school at the beginning of the 20th century given opportunity to every child to succeed at school and after on their life. However Alex Dupont explain that school reproduce social inequality. Most of low-income children will have bad makes. According to me, this theory able people to change their opinion on the school. Moreover with this evidences, politician have to change the organisation of school. Despite some change and knowledge of the population, I think is theory is still true. His sociological theory was the first on the subject. Thanks to him, lot of students and scientific continued after him to do some research on this subject, which is a important one for me, as every people of the country go to school. Consequently, we can create a better society if we have an equality school.', 'During the 13th centuray, Alex Dupont is the emperor of Paris.\\nHe decided to make an experiment to know the natural language of humans. He has took six orphan babies and has engaged few nurses to take care of their biological needs (food, sleep..). Nevertheless, nurses could not talk to babies.\\nAt the end of the experiment, any baby has talk and all babies died.\\n The experiment had tragics consequences.\\nIt proves that we need socialisation with others to survive.', \"I will talk about the Montessori method, it's based on autonomy and trust. In class chidren have activity that they could do whenever they want. The activities are about pratical life, like put some water in a bowl, clean a table with a sponge, or they are about mathematics or construction. The teacher isn't here to make them class like were used to in normel school, there's no table in front of the board especially in kindergarten. They are learning throught playing, and according to this pedagogy, they are learning at every moment of the day, even when they seem to just do a kapla tour or a drawing of an random house. In this method it's really important to let the child do things by himself even if he fail because it's a way of learning for him and being able to grow.\\n I think this pedagogy is adapted for kindergarten, is a way of discover school and be beeing more confident in their abilities before started learning in other classes later. I meet a teacher that using montessori inspiration and she have seen a reel progress of her class.\", \"I chose to go to university in the Faculty of Educational Sciences not because I've always knew I wanted to be a professor, or because I've always knew I wanted to work with children. Not because of that, but because in 2019, I went to Paris during 3 months. And during those 3 months, I've been working for only 2 days in a kindergarten class, with little kids who were only 3 years old. I was helping the teacher, I was playing with the kids, looking at them, helping them. And at the end of the day, I was feeling so happy and I wanted to go back with them. This bilingual class showed me how great it was to learn from them, and to teach them. Of course I didn't teach them a lot of my knowledge, but I didn't have to know a lot of things, or to speak fluently English. We understood each other, and it was a pleasure to speak to them in French a little.\\nThen, when I came back to Paris, I knew I wanted to work with kids, but I had no real experience. So, I decided to pass the BAFA. In Paris, it is kind of a test that you pass to work with kids. After that, I worked in a nursery during 8 months. It has been one of the best time of my life, and since then I knew I wanted to work with kids. The fact that you can enjoy your time around kids and that it is possible to make this thing a current way of life made me decide that I wanted to go to this university.\\nEven if I don't know yet what I exactly want to do as a job, I know I want to be near kids, especially young kids due to my experience, because I worked with kids from 3 to 11 years old. But I know that when you enter a faculty, no matter which one, your initial project can change so many times.\\nThe only veridic thing I know right now is that I can't wait to learn more about psychology, history and sociology in educational sciences.\", 'I made a very long way since I left hight school.

Beside, I made a stage in a class, wich changed me a lot and conforted me about my dream to become a teacher. I always wanted to be useful, helpful in my life, I want to erase social inequalities and give the same access to culture to every child. I also want to sensibilize about questions like the sexism, the racism, the autism and all subjects that children must know and have to be aware of. During the summer vacations, I used to work with childs in animation, I really grew up with this graduation and I love being useful, see how children can be amazed with all sorts of stuff. I enjoyed a lot give animations and answer to their questions, it's very grateful to play with them, learn about them ant teach them some things that can be useful in their lives.

But at this moment, I didn't really know why I wanted to do this kind of job. But today, I know.

So, I played with children, cried with children and lived with children all of my childhood. But when I grew up, I have also begin to teach them some things like how to say this word, or to speak this language... And I discovered that I really love to teach and help children and that I want to do a work with children. Unfortunately, my dream to become teacher has changed when I was in high school because all my life I had one and only one dream and I hadn't really think about any others jobs. That is why, I decided to change my mind to become a journalist and to choose in high school some subjects like SES or HGGSP that can help me for my future studies.. But, in order to work in summer, I decided to have my BAFA, that is a license that allows to work with children during the holidays. This experience was really amazing for me and allows me to realize that I would like to work with children. Moreover, I already work during the last holidays with children and it was a lot of fun.

This painting represent Alex Dupont who is a afro american girl. This girl walk to go at school bus this school is only for whites people. That why the girl is was escorted by four marshall. Alex Dupont is the first afro american girl who go in the school of white people at the segregation era. Furthermore, we can see in the background of the painting that people crushed tomatoes on Alex Dupont just because of his color skin.

In addition, i found this painting beautiful and i like the work of Alex Dupont.\\nAlex Dupont 2: I choose the science of education for many reasons but not necessarily to become school teacher. My first reason it\\'s just that the subject of the education interests me and I want to learnj more about the school and the education. My second reason to study the science of education is that I want maybe later to study the different forms of education of other countries. My goal is to travel in other countries to study the other school systems.\\nAlex Dupont 3: I want to go in scandinavian countries to study the other school systems but to realize this dream I need a scholarship.

I want to learn how to work with them, to develop their autonomy.', 'I don\\'t actually know for sure what i want to do after my graduation but I think I know why I want to work in education.\\nFirst, school wasn\\'t always a peaceful place for me. I experienced harassement and social anxiety since my very first day in \"sixième\". In highschool I joined a club (created by the school with the help of the school nurse and some teachers) fighting against harassement, racism, sexism and homophobia. We did a lot of prevention, education in class and created an entire day dedicated to the club where students were invented to share, talk about their experience or offered to help their pairs. In my youth and as far as i can remember, I always found these topics very important. Now that I am (almost) an adult and my voice is finally strong enough (not as strong I want it to be, even though I\\'m older, I\\'m still a woman.) I want to dedicate my time to help others, mostly teenagers and young adults. I want them to be able to use their voices, have the rights they deserve without having to fight for them.\\nI want to work in the education system to educate, help and provide safety to children, teenagers and young adults fighting inequalities.\\nI remember my mum telling me that no matter how hard I\\'ll try, I won\\'t be able to change the world. I want to prove to someone that, even if I\\'m not able to change the world and eradicate inequalities, I can help and try to save many people by preventing and educating. I think it\\'s enough, and necessary.\\nSo, I don\\'t really know what I want to do for a living right now, but I know that I want to protect teenagers against hate and inequalities by teaching them how to respect and help each other.', \"Why I want became a teacher ?\\nDuring my school years, I change a lot of time my project for my futur..\\nSometimes I wanted to be a math teacher in college, sometimes I wanted to be a science teacher in university..\\nBut, next year I realized that I needed to be with children.\\nAnd I'm pretty sure it's my mom my source of inspiration.\\nIndeed, my mom is child minder since almost 15 years or more.\\nSo since I'm a child, I always had babies et children in my house (and in my life) and I always love this environment.\\nI always had fun help my mom to care of them.\\nThen I realized that I always wanted teach but with children.\\nThis environment in my house, I want the same in my job and I want have the smile the morning when I will go\\nwork .\\nFurthermore, I hope I will create a link with my futur student just like I did with the children that my mother keeps.\\nFinally, I want thank's my mom for teach me so many things without knows that will help me for my futur job.\", 'My insperation for the study is my Service Civique.

I need help for the choice because is important. The other teacher with i have work, allowed me learn the job.', \"Since few years, I am definitely sure that my job has to be school teacher.\\nAt first, I am feeling that children are my passion. Indeed, I like not only to play and to talk to them but also to try to understand the way they think and act. I am working as an animator and when I am going to work, I can't wait to see them, I am sure that I am going to have a great day thanks to them.\\nSecondly, the teacher job is a job that I'm interested in since few years now because since I am a child, I've always liked to teach things. For instance, I am used to learn my classes by explaining them to an imaginary class in my room. It seems weird like that but it is very useful ! I liked to propose my help to my class students if they did not understand a notion as well. In other words, help people and especially at school is a thing that I could do during hours. But I am very conscious that to teach is not an easy thing because I talk about it with a lot of teachers especially from primary school and it takes a lot of time and it's necessary to be patient and organised but I feel that I am able to do that.\\nFinally, I want to work especially with children because I am feeling that they are necessary to my happiness and my development on earth : I am a very anxious person and I feel that I'm lost in the adult world. Therefore, when I'm with children, I am forgetting my problems because I don't have the time to think about them as I have to take care of a group of children.

This profession consist of find contracts for the actors and anythings else.

Lately, by chosing my actual studies void, i\\'ve been thinking about \"Where I can go to achieve my dream job?\" Because, as you certainely know, this world is quiet selective so being appart of it it\\'s difficult and ask some relations or luckiness.To me, communication is the \"easier\" way to enter in fashion and moreover reach my dream job.\\nBut, to be honest, I don\\'t have one single job in my mind. The goal is to work in it but maybe by being multifonctional : working for some fashion magazines, lead a complete editorial, manage the graphism of a brand or even more being in charge of events. I think that the fashion industry is larger than people think and can be very versatile.\\nTo talk more about this passion, from where it cames I wanted to tell you more about my childhood. My big sister was very interested by fashion magazines and always wanted to be a stylist. Growing up next to her, introduce me to this world. Having this relationship with fashion, since I was like 6-7yo, allow me to become the person I am today.\\nNow that I grow up, fashion take a huge place in my daily life, making me feel more confident. It inspires me so much throught social medias or magazines.\\nA lot of people think that it\\'s superficial, something that doesn\\'t matter or only for the people who have any struggle or problems in their life. But to me, this is something bigger than that. Everybody must be interested by what they wear. Being concerned by the clothes you put in your skin, can made you feel stronger.

First, my dad worked for a big company as well as my aunt, so they inspired me. When they were talking about their jobs I really wanted to do the same. They were travelling all around Paris or Paris, and all over the world so from a point of vue of a child that was like a dream. I know that the reality is very different but I can see myself in this type of job. You need to be confident, don't be scared to talk to over people, you need to know a lot of things about different topics, like today social medias are really important with videos... I think you have to be also a bit artistic and I like that. Also you can work alone as well as in group and I really feel that this is for me.\\nAlso, in this type of job we have to talk over language and I really want to be bilingual in the future, in English obviously, but also in Spanish.

That created a revolution in world because it give us the possibility to speak with absolutly everybody we want always even if we want to stay at home, so it make the communication strongest than ever.\\nIn my opinion, that created and destroyed the communication in the same time. We know that help us to make our communication better with our family, our friends etc... of course that help us to have a better communication. But that could make us stop to see the people in the \"real world\", in fact, phone could help more to stay alone than meet other person.

There is lots of characters with some issues: Alex Dupont has weight issues, Alex Dupont is in a toxic relationship with Alex Dupont (the boy who represent the most the toxic masculinity), Alex Dupont is a transexual girl. The show talk about lot of things that teenagers have to fight during this life moment. We have lot of flashback in the season 1 when we learn more about the characters and why they have these issues. These flashback make me love a lot of characters in the show. The realisator let the spectators discover a new vision of the teenage life. We always see in a lots a movies or shows the teenage dream like something cool and easy. But Euphoria shows the reality. This moment of the life is the moment when we learn who we are and what we want becoming. The first season of this show is cool, but I prefer the season 2 when we learn more about the characters and how interesting they are. I take the exemple of the character Alex Dupont, she's the bestfriend of Alex Dupont. When Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont just broke up, Alex Dupont has a secret relationship with Alex Dupont. Obviously, Alex Dupont doesn't know that. Lot of people can hate the character of Alex Dupont for this reason but this is not what happened.

It all started when I first read Harry Potter. I was in primary school and it was one of the first book that inspired me. Alex Dupont's style and the way that she made me feel while reading the book as if I was living the story felt extraordinary to me. I started the international section in 6ème so that I could learn English and, one day, be able to write in both languages for international newspapers. While learning American history and literature, I discovered works such as Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet by Alex Dupont, or even The Handmaid's Tale by Alex Dupont, which made me like literature even more.\\nMy family has been a host family for the program SYA, an American school in Paris since 2016, so I grew up meeting American students and talking with them about important subjects such as abortion or politics. It has been a great opportunity for me to learn more about the American culture. Therefore, I was able to read the New York Times and talk about the articles that were interesting to me with my American friends.\\nMoreover, The New York Times has been the greatest inspiration for me to become a journalist. When I read an article a journalist wrote in that newspaper, I know that the information has been studied and proven, but also that most of the time, they are written by people who come from the country, or who studied the subject they're writing about. I think it is an even better newspaper than the ones we have in Paris, as they write about anything happening in the world. It does not have a political opinion, and is even trying to find writers from all political sides, to create an interesting conversation between readers.\\nFinally, I have started reading the articles that Alex Dupont was sending to Vogue during World War 2, as a reporter in Paris. This book which contains all of her reports from the war is now an inspiration for me, as she was a journalist but also a photograph and a model for Vogue. I discovered her book by accident in the library, and I fell in love with her style and the book. She could write with nothing but a pencil and a used piece of paper during a bombarding and still manage to describe the horrors that she was seeing, and the joy she felt as she and other solders were sharing a meal or taking a bath. Alex Dupont is the first woman to have even been a war reporter, and my wish is to write articles as good as hers in The New York Times one day, if I can, of course, achieve my dream.\", 'I go to give my opinion about the telecommuting.

I can't discribe how I love to discover the news trends, to make some research about the brands that I like, and to dress up and mix all the pieces of clothes that I have.\\nMy second passion is music, and one more time this is something that gives some amazing feelings. I love discover some brandnews musics artists or styles. I adore the fact that through music you can brought the things that you want, your hapiness, your sadness, your pride, everything. I would like to make music in the future tho. I have many artists that inspires me in this industry, I can tell for example Alex Dupont a rapper, Alex Dupont an R&B singer but I can't tell all the artists that I love because they are as numerous as the number of the trees from our earth.\\nThe studies that I chose will make me able to realise many things in a profession that i chose and in an industry that I chose too, here fashion or music. The profession that I would like to do are link to, or adverstising or factual, to industry that are important for music and fashion. I would love to crate some visual or to propose my ideas and then see the results in tv or on the big panel in Paris for example.

First, I have a friends and a cousin in this licence. They know me and they sold to me I would like these studies. So I did some research and I think correspond to the profils requested in this licence. I like work alone and in groupe, also I like a possible jobs after the studies, witch are large and varied. What interest me the most it's around the event, particulary in the fashion world. It's only a first idea at the moment. My research, the documentaries and videos about this licence or some jobs confirmed my choice.\", \"I am a student in information and communication, i choose the second subject because the reason i decided to follow the cursus of the information and communication is without hesitation my biggest hobby, which is Music.\\nI am fond of music, I listen to it every day, learn things about It and I even do some with friends of mine. Particculary underground french rap which mean underrated artists. So, I follow these studies with the aim of working with music because I want to have fun working later, I don't know preciselly what I want to do but maybe I could make my own music, maybe i could be the community manager of an artist I like. Two others works who can be link with the music that i could like are graphist for some musicals projects ( create alubms cover, the graphic direction of a project...) or doing the communication / organisations of some musicals events ( concerts, festivals... ).\\nI listen to music every day since I am fourteen and i really started to interest to it professionnaly since 4 or 5 month only but I never appreciated a thing more than doing music actually. My biggest source of inspiration for that adventure is Alex Dupont, he is a french rapper, not very famous, that i listen since the month of may, I think he is a really interesting rapper because he have is own universe and he is mostly like mine, he use a lot of internet reference of my childhood and even now. Moreover, he Is only eighteen, like me, and that Is very inspirative because when listening to him, I'm thinking that it could be me, he started doing rap at 15 so I have a bit of time to catch to be like him, I have to work hard.\\nHe is the major reason why music inspires me so much everyday.\\nIf you have a little bit of time, I reccomand to you to go listen to his newest album: Luther - Garçon, a unique and immersive piece of art.\", 'Dear college,\\nWell I am going to defend the major manga of these several past 20 years : « One Piece ». Even if I’m a huge fan, I will try to be objective.\\nFirst, I think I am going to present you this beautiful story. The young man Alex DupontD.Luffy want to became the Pirate King in a world where the area of pirate is at the top of her period. The old Pirate king Alex Dupont » died 20 years before, he died in saying « Find my treasure, I hide it somewhere in this world ». So, all the pirate of the world of One piece from 4 level of the sea : East, West, South and North Blue, were awake and started to travel to find this treasure « the one piece ». Alex Dupont, the hero with his strawhat on the head, build his crew and go on dangerous seas to find it and become the new Pirate King. But on his way, he will met a lot of ennemis and new friends too. Alex Dupont is a pretty dumb guy but he’s motivation is without limits. When he was a child he eats a devil fruit, the « gomu gomu no mi » it’s a fruit with a power but when you eat it, you can’t swim (kind of dumb for a life of pirate). This fruit makes Alex Dupont an Elastic man.\\nOne piece is interesting because the author treated every subjects in it that we live in our world, happy subject but a lot of horrible reality too. Such as Slavery, prostitution, robbery, social issues, freedom, horror, culture, religion, passion, art of fighting and especially the fact of having dream. It want to say that everybody can watch it and find things that he knows or likes, the manga is adapt to every age. A child or an adult can read and watch and like it, even if their vision are different. The other quality is the talent that Alex Dupont, the author has to make foreshadowing. It’s when you understand something in the story several chapters later. Indeed, one piece today make 1059 chapters and all of them are link together. Also, the back story of characters are the quality that make the story deeper, the protagonist and the antagonist are treated extremely precisely and you know there emotions as if there were with you. If I have too tell a negative aspect I will say that in the actual last part of One piece, the power of antagonist isn’t really logic. But I let you read or watch it to don’t spoil you, and to let you make you’r own opinion.\\nFinally, we can say that One Piece is an dramatic, beautiful, realistic work with a lot of fantasy. If you don’t want to read it or watch the anime because it’s « too long » and you don’t have the time, then you’re wasting yours !', \"I draw everyday since I'm 8, and I read and write stories since i'm 10.

I just could have chosen to study art in a private school to become a graphic designer and then an art director (This path is the most common after all). But how will I be able to lead a team, to interact with other companies, to deal with sponsorships, to travel all around the world, if I am not mastering the way of communication ? I may be wrong but I think- I believe i made a good choice. My path will be different from the other's, but it's for the best.\\nThat's the reason i've chosen to study Infocom.

But at one point i share a picture with my friends it was on june 2018 and i saw under my photo some nice comments from my friends, it\\'s maybe naive but it\\'s made me happy. And i think it\\'s thanks to my friends that i have more confidence in myself and i post more pictures of myself. As i said before, to me it was a good experience because i have some awesome friends who are really nice, and i think i am not a person with \"enemi\", i get along pretty well everyone. What is more serious is the harassment, it\\'s can happened to everyone, famous people or a classmate. Because with the anonymity it\\'s easier to hide behind your computer to judge and criticize others. And i think you have to be sure of yourself for create an account on social network and to have a minimum of supervision on your children because it can be very dangerous.', 'In 1454, Alex Dupont invented the printing press. This invention is a fundamental advance in the field of communication. The invention of the printing press made it possible to democratize access to books, which were previously reserved for monks. Printing also revolutionized the transmission of knowledge and currents of thought.\\nFor me, printing is an invention that has made history. Indeed, it allows the propagation of books, books that allow us to cultivate ourselves, to learn to read and to disseminate knowledge in a general way. This advance is comparable for the time to the invention of the Internet in the twentieth century.\\nPrinting allows in a greater sense the dissemination of information and allows easier communication between continents.', 'I\\'ll explain one of the point of view you can have about communication. Effectively, communication don\\'t take root in a specifical place and time. Many théories about it borned and today I\\'ll describe Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont diagram. Alex Dupont describes communication like a mathematical problem. In few words, for him it\\'s an information wich dropped from an transmitter, passed through a canal and arrived at the receiver. He calls \"technical noises\" problem that could happen in canal. Then, Alex Dupont humanise the diagram with \"semantic noises\", noises that comes from the human. The message is not clear and avoid the receiver\\'s comprehension. It could be a reference that one have and not an another or a phrase that the receiver don\\'t now.\\n I think Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont diagram is good to know for the culture and to start with communication theories. However, it isn\\'t as specific as he could.\\nI don\\'t think that, if you to be a professional in a communication area, it is sufficient to know. The diagram is very simple and probably don\\'t take into account all the issues, or subtitles necessary.', \"Internet is an invention that completely change our society and communication. Before internet people learn about news in journal papers on television, even on radio. Now we can search nexs on internet very easily. You don't even need dictionary, we can find everything on internet, with google for example. Every media had a characteristic. With television you can watch, hear, and read, but radio was all about hearing and journal papers was all about reading. Today with internet, you can watch radio, you can hear papers. Internet gather all media on one tool. All you need now is a computer, a smartphone watch tv, hear radio or even read journal papers. Every radio has a website, as journal papers and television. You can find a lot on internet nearly everything. You can buy thing, sell things, watch movies, talk to your friends or family, you can learn and do many more.\\n Internet has many consequences, some are good, others are bad. First of all, internet enabled people to learn more. People have access to a lot of knowledge, it helps people to have a wider acces to education. Internet give acces to culture and education to Alex Dupont who wants to. A lot of company, business have grown thnaks to internet. They developp website so they can have business everywhere in the world. Even though internet is a good thing in our society it has also bad effects. People live more behinf a screen, they talk more to people behind screen and less with real contact with others. People are more isolated from others, they have less contact with humans, with interact more behinf a screen. Moreover, people are addicted to internet and all we can do with it. With internet Social media have a big place in our lives and people begin to have addiction to it. People spend a lot of time behind their screens and less time outside in the real world. Because of internet people are addicted to their screens and they don't want to miss a notification.\", '\\n\\nToday, mass media are everywhere around us, we can’t escape from them. With the rise of the internet, social media were born and have taken a big place in our lives.\\nFacebook, created by Alex Dupont in 2004 paved the way to the other social media. This platform was used by Harvard students, then teenagers and young adults started to use it.\\nToday, Facebook is the biggest social media, all generations are using it. Now, several other social media have been created : Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Tik Tok...\\nA lot of teenagers left Facebook for a younger platform because of the popularity of Facebook among adults.\\n \\n\\nI think social networks are a great creation, however there are some side effects. First of all, this is very addictive and we can’t stay away from them. Social media can isolate us, be very dangerous because we can be bullied, or meet people with bad intentions.\\nSocial networks were made to hypnotize us, the more we stay, the more money is earned by the platform.\\nSocial networks can also be a very good thing, we can communicate with anybody in the world, we can meet new people and have access to a lot of information quickly.\\nIn order to keep our mind healthy, we need to limit our time on social networks and privilege our interactions with people around us. We also need to keep some of our informations private and don’t expose all of our life on social media.', \"Being in information and communication licence, I'm going to describe a technology developed over the years to facilitate communication not on Earth but in an environment wich is much more distant to us: space. In fact, this communication can be altered by distance, it's nonetheless ultra powerfull, generally, communication between Earth and space is done in real time, but when communication is over a long distance, the signal can take several days to arrive! Indeed, when we launch a spaceship into space, different types of communications must be created, for example, communication between astronauts and the person in charge of the mission, who are on Earth, communication between astroanuts present in the same ship, and finally communication between the spaceship and Earth. In order to have perfect communication between Earth and space, the technologies used must be ultra efficient and offer a margin of error close to 0, otherwise, poor communication could be fatal and cause the mission to fail, or even worse, put in danger the astronauts, so we use sophisticated radios. Currently we also know an advanced technology related to space communication: satellites. thanks to all these communication technologies, science can advance but the human side is not put aside, in fact, for a space mission takes place in the best possible conditions, astronauts must be at their maximum of their capacity, this is why communication is also established between astronauts and their families via blof, chat and other... Space technology in connection with efficient communication will continue over the years and centuries to facilitate communication between our planet and space until one day may allow us to communicate with a new form of life.\\n In my opinion, the growth of communications technologies in the space sector hasn't ceased to impress us and I don't think that this improvment in technology is harmful to humans, on the contrary, to communicate outside our home planet can only increase our knowledge about space which we still know only a little part and thanks to communication science could make a gigantic step forward. What intrigues me most about communication with space is knowing that one day maybe this communication will allow us to come into contact with a new form of life and that would be exceptional for the advancement of science and consideration of the human species.\", \"I don't realy know what I can write here but I think that I will talk about Smartphone. In fact, it's an invention or a new tecnique very important in our society. We use this item every day in our daily in all situations. It bring together different medias like television, radio or newspaper for example and it’s an important way of communication. Indeed, it allow to be in contact with other people but with the world too. Moreover the access at the information is easier.\\n In my opinion, this invention has different consequences. First, I think that people are addict to it, it became a necessity for everyone. Then, we can say that it have changed our vision of the wolrd for exemple with our relation to time. Indeed, with this item, everything go faster, our days are planned up to the minute. With the calendar, notifications of events or maps which permit to know the itinerary's time. Moreover, we have access to the information all around the world whithout problem. So it change our relation to the world.\", \"Today, I'm going to introduce a mobile application called OneFootball. OneFootball was founded in 2008 in Paris by Alex Dupont, and is now headquartered in Paris. This application is available for free to all football fans worldwide and is a reliable source of football information. I discovered this application about three years ago and I still use it every day. Thanks to this medium, I can follow the results of all professional matches in the world in real time, as well as be kept up to date with all the vital information within football.  As a supporter of the Marseille team, I am also subscribed to their account, and I can receive notifications directly if there is a goal, a red card, half-time, etc... This media is very useful to me every day and I am very happy to be able to use it.\\n I think that this medium has only good consequences for its users, the majority of people who use it are fully satisfied with this application and recommend it to their friends. It brings nothing but goodwill and has become a central and serious medium in the world of football. It even manages to distinguish fakes news and warn its audience about them. I recommend this application for every football fan and hope that it can become even more emancipated.\", 'I introduce instagram, is a platform to share our arts or anything else with some photo to share it at the friends or the worlds.\\n Instagram is a good application because it’s can be make you famous with a lot of luck and make your arts for example in the view of million people but the problem with that for example a lot of model is on instagram and a lot of « perfect » body to, and it can makes some complex to the people  or more specifically to the younger.', \"During my first semester, I discover different inventions, schemes, and technologies around the theme of medias.\\nOne of this things is radio. Actually, radio is one of the most popular means of communication. This wasn't the case before the 19th century. I really like this mean of communication beacause i find it original. You can imagine how the talking person looks like, what his reactions are, and so on. Everything is in his voice. You don't need to see this person.\\nAlso, radio played a major role in History. For example, during the II World War, radio helped resistants.\\n I really think that radio is one of the only media who hasn't a lot of bad consequences on the auditorium.\\nIt allows us to know the news without being in front of a screen.\", \"Twitter. Twitter is a social network that has been very used for some years. On Twitter it is possible to discurs news topics with other people online. It is the social network that allows many people to follow the news live through the differents media accounts that are registered with it. Twitter is for me a source of inexhaustible information, and allows us to be informed about topics that do not necessairly interest us. It is possible to discuss with people from all over the world and to know their views on certain things in life. Twitter also allows me to chat with my friends and communicate with them everydays.\\n But, you have to be careful with Twitter, because some informations is wrong, that's what we call fake news. So you can talk anonymously, that's what can cause tensions between different people.The information is not filtering, he many have shocking photos or videos... Twitter is dangerous for me beacause some people who many not realize the violence of the words... I think it's important to prevent risks on social networks and limit access to children. Twitter has become the social network that allows you to share your opinion with everyone\", \"Eurosport is a TV channel which broadcasts most of the world's sporting events. This media allow me to follow especially tennis Grand Chelem tournament, all winter sports too and finally a lot of of football match. There is also the Eurosport app which allow me to have results in real time.   It is for me a beautiful discovery. I am immediately informed of sports results that interest me. I discovered this sports media like everyone else I think, with the advertisements. Only downside, some sports are not broadcast on the television channel but the application still broadcasts the results.\\n This discovery is therefore more than positive for me, I manage to follow sports news while continuing my other activities.\", \"One of social media that I find very interesting is really Facebook. For me, the faculty of Facebook to be so open for all people is scheming. Indeed, Facebook is the social media that is the most download around me even for the adult. Personally I know more adult who using Facebook than teens.\\nI think we could explain that because Facebook offer you suggestion very around our interest. People have just to follow their friends and they see contents that we already know. Consequently, we are not disoriented with new contents and create a comfort feeling.\\nFinally, I can explain the stronger using of Facebook of adults than teens, with the strong algorithm of it.\\n I'm a bit exaggerated in my description but I think in very important and very good. For me this is what makes its strength.\\nWith this very good algorithm, Facebook is perpetuities even with the younger people who first know Facebook with their parents for exemple. Also, the easy using of all his service makes of Facebook the biggest social media of the decade.\", \"First of all, I would like to talk about the Instagram social network. It's an application which was founded and lauchned in October 2010 by the American and the Brazilian Alex Dupont.\\nAt the current time, it is one of the most used social networks in the world with Snapchat, Youtube... On Instagram, we can share photos and videos, watch stories. Furthermore, there are two types of accounts, for example companies can be in professional account to have access to more functionnalities and the ordinary people are in private or not, they have the choice.\\nFinally, know, the name Instagram is built from Insta from the English Instant camera and gram from the English word telegram.\\n To begin, i discovered the application Instagram when i was a teenage girl, in high school probably.\\nTo my mind, i think that this application has positive aspects and negative aspects. On the one hand, this application is positive because it has for goal to entertain the people who use it and so have a good time on it. Then, from my point of view, I would say the app is universal because it has so much functionality, besides I'm still discovering some.\\nOn the other side, it can be negative for certain people because they are bad people, who posts a nasty comment or people who are using this social network the wrong way.\", \"I'm gonna talk about the TV. In my opinion, the tv is a technological advance that changed the life of some peoples in the world because the tv makes possible to inform, to relax, to laugh for example and to spend time with her family that is something which is something really important and vital for me. It allowed us to discover many movies with good actors and these actors gain their money with there movies so the tv allow people to dreaming and maybe some people have the dream to became an actor. Moreover, the tv is in constant progress with the technologie because the tv in 90's are note the same than the tv of our days.  I think that the consequences of tv are good if the using of tv is well. This technologie will allow many people to watch the world information and I think that is very important in 2021 to be aware of what is happening all the days in the world. But, on another side, I think that we have to pay attention and supervise the Alex Dupont who spend too much time watching tv and their social lives reduce.\", 'I talk about the television. The television progress since several years, but since 21 century it evolution know a lot of progress. First, there are many of television channel, more and more programs about all of subject. The number of the viewer are also increase since the 20 century but internet substitue it in the mind of the population for several reasons. Even if the television knows a progress, some of program are censor and the information program are use by politics to control the \"society\". So, many of viewer use internet to pass through the censor and to have a free information.  I think a television are good tool if it not control by the big societies. It permit to watch a lot of program or movies. However, the television channel knows a censor according to if it was a propriety of private or public group. Example : the private group choose what he doesn\\'t want to diffuse on his channel and can be censor what he wants. In this way if we don\\'t know who have the channel, we don\\'t know there are a form of censor on this channel and we can think this channel are nice. It\\'s can be a problem also with the public channel, for the election for example, the group, the candidate who has more money for his campaign can be more at the television and he have more chance to become president because people see him more often. Indeed, the television with the publicity encourage people to buy and consume whereas the planet need than we are more responsable and we give a second life of the object, practice the hand-me down and stop ever buy.', \"In my formation Information-Communication, I discovered autors with thought different. For example, I have learned that Alex Dupont, how was great sociologist, he said that television was dangerous for people because they were unable that go out of grip of mass medias. A lot of autors are defeanding this idea. In information-communication, we learn that mass medias have power to concentred people, and after, the people can weigh fake news. Information-communication shows what not go in trap.\\n This discovery allows to take hindsight on the mass medias and not  believe medias of 100%. Always have consciences that truth is complicated to have, and even for medias. The medias just try to gain of money.\\nAnd it's shown with actual period: with a coronavirus. The medias can say anything, and mostly on the pandemic just to have a spectators.\", \"During my study i'm discover the field of communication. An more precily the social\\nmedia, and their effect on us. I study about the consequence of the social life. The impact of the child who used this new technology.\\n The experience has very importante for me, because i don't agree with this sociaty who people spend a lot of time on the internet and especially on social netword. I like to discover the consequences of the social life. For exemple Instagram, who the people past a lot of time to compart other people. The social media as Instagram, create a lack of self-confidence.\", \"The invention of televison was a massive advance in the 30's. It was the first time that we can had in our living room an image moving with sound. This invention was a big change in the world. We can saw much of things that before with only one little screen. The television become an influent way of communication very quickly. TV debates, daily news, sports and others programs become more popular thanks to television. In Paris TV in color arrived in the late 70's and it's basically at this moment that we saw the power of television.\\n I think in nowadays television it's decreasing. The new generation is bored about seeing the same way of entertainment every day. The TV News are less viewed by the people thanks to the speed of internet. Even now if some of the content on TV can be in full hd or 4k, they are used to see platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc and no more to see TV News. I think that TV become more than just TV Channels and that is a very important problem for the industry of television entertainment. I think television still have an influence in people mind but new generations are getting older and on these generations TV is having less influence than social media or new streaming platforms.\", \"I m going to speak about the creation of social media. The social media are a way to communicate with other people and share our life with picture, videos. For exemple, Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat are this types of social media. The social media are also a place to give his opinion, like Twitter. The first social media was Classmates.com, created in 1995 by Alex Dupont to communicate with his friends. Facebook, one of the biggest social media was created by Alex Dupont on February  4, 2004.\\n I think the social media have positive and negative points. I think that's a good thing because the social media facilitate the communication between us, and it's more easely to have a social interaction. It's also more easely to communicate at professional level, because we can work, like today, in virtual classroom. So, I think the remote work can stay an option in the futur. But, the social media are also negative. If we are always in social media, we live in a virtual world, and that's can be dangerous for our healthy. Moreover, they have on social media lot of fake news, and we need to be careful at this informations.\", \"New technologies have fostered communication, especially during confinement. They allowed her to stay in touch with her family and her friends. You can communicate with people on social media, by message. We can also call each other by seeing the person with Facetime. It's important to keep a connection with people so you don't shut yourself out.  For me, I find it convenient and important to use social networks to communicate with others peoples. But, it can have negative effects like harrassment. You need to know how to use social networks properly and sensibly.\", \"I will talk about the explosion of Internet and the influence of this technologie about the circulation of information.\\nEven if Intenet was created in the end of the 19e century, his expansion started in 2000's. The number of computer increase and the number of Website too.\\n This technologie made possible the research of information very quickly.\\nPeople no longer have to wait for a specific time the news at the TV but they can research everythings at everytime on Internet.\\nMoreover, the large utilisation of this invention allows the contribution of everyone, so all can share what we know for an other persons learn somethings.\\nBut we have to take care of fakes.\", \"When I was little, the world was really different from now. The 21st century had just began and many ways of communication had seen the light throught the years. One of the most important for me wad the creation of the laptop. Appeared in 1981, the first laptop was an incredible revolution for those who needs to work in unusual places like planes or trains. Its size greatly reduced allowed people to transport it wherever they wanted, and its weight of just 12 Kilos made its use very practical. However, the use of these laptops was strictelly professional. Nowadays, laptops have evolved and offer even more possibilities. First, the use of these tools had become more recreational over the years, and it's now possible to watch movie, play video games or even listen to music with a laptop thanks to the internet. Of course, it still almost essential to possess a laptop for work, but they not reduce to this utility. Then, laptops have change the world of communication, with the apparition of social media and others platform. Meeting people virtually is now possible and available for everyone, for exemple, many people now have friends they haven't meet in real life who lives miles from them. But, the more impressive evolution is that now, we can access to almost every knowledges on earth. Discovering something is now so easy, and open the doors of a new world of consciousness.\\n I find that in the first place this evolution cannot be wrong for the humankind. Everything is easelly available, even a child can make a search on the internet. Working on a laptop is also pleasant and can be done everywhere. But I think these developements can be really dangerous on the long term. Knowledge is now so easy to access that many of us have stop thinking by themselves. If they want to answer the easiest question, internet and the laptop know the answer, if they need life advice, the same thing happen. So many people now can't live without a laptop, without being connected to the world and the others. Children are no longer children and many spend their day in front of a screen, watching mediocre content. But there isn't only bad things about these laptop. It allowed everyone to know and communicate freely, to discover and learn.\", \"During my first semester we studied television and teh effects it had on us.We have seen that television is a media which is now 50 years old.It is a media that uses the power of images.I wish to stress that the television is part mass media.It's a media that uses codes especially in the manipulation.A lot people people watch television, it is a media that makes reference in information, but when you look more closely, it is a media that uses a lot of technique to manipulate opinion.\\nDuring the first semester, the teachers showed us and gave us elements to have a critical look at a medium such as television.This allowed us to have a different perspective on this medium. From this we were able to analyze the effects of television and the disinformation it could have.\\nThe teachers gave us videos and texts to analyze to make us understand certain aspects of television.We also had a lot of theory lessons to show us the world of media. We saw the history of media and television, which allowed us to see the manipulation, the techniques,the formats used by it.I'm sorry, i find it difficult to express my opinion.\", 'How mobile phone changed the world\\nTo begin, i will start to introduce one of the biggest technology revolution of the world: the mobile phone. The first one was sold in 1983 in Paris. Since 1983, innovation, progress, and invention are goals for mobile phone compagnies. In fact, nowadays, we can write messages, call one or several persons wherever you want, record our voices, take pictures and videos and do much more things with a mobile phone.\\n In my opinion, mobile phone has good and bad sides. I will take an example to talk about each sides.\\nFirst of all, the mobile phone has totally changed our way to live our lifes. For exemple, thanks to this invention, people which were far away from us, can be online at the same time as us. This is quiet amazing. So, the sad feelings when you miss somebody can be erase thanks to the mobile phone.\\nHowever, In my mind, it is seems like we can do anything with a mobile phone. It is a little bit scarrying. In fact, we have to prevent every mobile phone user about the dangers it can produce. Furthemore, with Internet the danger increase a lot. This technological inventions can destroy people lifes, just if you meet bad people online or talk with a malicious person.', 'Policies or economic markets would decide what we need, technology would justmeet needs that satisfy external demand. and yet the technics exerted on us and our environmenta way of thinking, of perceiving, of experiencing time and space, has chosen that politics or economics are unable to do. the technics allows us to meet our needs through series of deviceobjects. technology has exerted immediate transformations on us such as the industrial revolutionand the beginning of the machines to move and work. before all inventions, it was impossible to move from pontto point other than with help of animals, especially horses. it was therefore necessary to plan his trip, the duration of the latter then counted in daysor even in week. the distance had therefore become has great. the experience of the trip was quite different from that of today. we used to limit our movements and if they had to do it, most often they were limited to moving around the place of life. the industrial revolution, and the appearance of new techniques, will profoundly change our perception and who we are.the tradition of western thought takes its inspiration from Greek philosophy, it apprehends technique as a circumscribed domain of human action which falls under specific laws, because among the Greekswatts falls under craftsmanship is different from acting. therefore ethics policy. in Ancient Greece was reserved for the elite, work was concisedered humiliating and therefore entrusted to slaves, and artisanalproduction was relegated to the rank of sub-activity. the artificiality of man will change with a series of technical acts. from a technical device we can govern the others. the fundamental question of technique is the question of the more or less predictable transformation that man will exert on himself though processes of externalization into facto techniques.\\n\\n Developments in technical systems are therefore no longer driven by the desire to meet direct and concrete needs,\\nbut by the need to meet the needs of other technical sub-system. this creates a huge problem of continuity of worlds between\\ngenerations since the advancement of rapid technologies facing individuals and societies are imposed on them.\\ntechnique is in a way constitutive of humanity or of our humanities. there are techniques affecting our life forms in quite different ways.\\nindustrial techniques somehow improve the quality of human life, but the speed of change sometimes creates misunderstandings and affects people\\nin the wrong way. faced with his own inventions and technical developments, man does not adapt as quickly as he makes them evolve.', \"As a young woman, often on social media, there are so many topics that I can depict from my experiences. I'm aware that this is a subject that has been particularly present in our society. Due to the fact that mass media has great importance in one's life and the world in general.\\nFirst and foremost, I would like to emphasize the fact that society is becoming a place where protection is not guaranteed because of its effectiveness of profanity and nudity. There is less supervision on what can be posted. People are forgetting that younger children are also frequently on social media. Therefore, the problem comes mostly from our society that makes it seems normal to give children mobiles, tablets at such young age.\\nSecondly, social media depicts perfection and mostly only that! An influencer that looks « perfect » is looked up to by thousands of people.\\nSome young women are defining their beauty according to social media's beauty standards.\\nLet's talk about those Influencers, entertainers that are paid thousands for their looks and videos. Indeed people are being paid to make thousands of people watch them behind a camera. Currently, being an influencer is a job. It is known that some influencers are paid more doctors because they sometimes reach a higher audience.\\n In our century, our generation, social media can be a big threat for children because of the lack of protection. Indeed, the parents have all the responsibility and they are supposed to pay attention to what their kids do or watch.\\nAlthough it is becoming more difficult not giving kids phones. The society of today considers that not giving a child a phone knowing that the child is surrounded by other children with a mobile phone will put the child in a situation of lack and inferiority. In my opinion, it will disturb the child if he has not been thought that it is not essential and that he has to have boundaries if he eventually gets one.\\nThe fact that social media makes some people insecure about themselves can create insecurities for some. Some women are taking advice from the influencer's and they are spending thousands on plastic surgery. Although social media depicts perfection, there is still a small number of people fighting for acceptance of themselves, and social media also supports those people with hashtags like #bodypositivity.\", \"Social networks started in the early 2000's with Facebook and twitter, today they are part of majority of people in their daily lives. Social networks are platforms for connecting individuals online. We can see on social networks posts like pictures, videos or personals texts... The most famous networks are sources of information in their own right. Stars, politicians... everyone are today on social networks. Consequently, social networks are essential in the field of communication and actuality. Communities and individuals are always bombarded with different messages. It's not only products that are shown but also what is sensed to be good and not, moods, attitudes...\\n Groups produce divergent interpretation in terms on age, gender, religious... More and more we see the youngest having access to social networks. It should have an age limit because a teenager is not built enough to say that is good and that is bad on what he sees on social networks. Social networks influence those who are less informed and people who don't relied on their personal experience, or their own reasoning.\\nWith social networks people combine the other ways to think of, they interact with media to create their own meanings out of images and messages they receive. We can called these people active people. And social networks can be a good way to stay informed bc on television or even in newspaper ideas are often the same and politically driven, while on social networks there are divergent opinions where you can debate and make your own opinion on the actuality ect... Unfortunately with creation of an algorithm on social networks, we will be forced without knowing it to see things, ideas that are similar, therefore we lose this idea of divergent opinions, it can be anxious and we risk forgetting that our way of thinking isn't the only and isn't necessarily judged as good.\", \"The texhnology who represent the must my speciality is internet.

Alex Dupont was sociologist of 20th century and has worked on lot of subject as \"On the television\" who has been a book. In this book, the author speacks on Collège de France lessons. He speacks of his discovered on the subject television. He speacks invisibable censure of television, than television has lot of impact on peoples, television can developped anxiety, and peoples not think because it\\'s television who think for peoples.\\n I think than Alex Dupont theory is correct. We are in the world where there is lot of screen. Actually with a smartphone but, before, a television. Alex Dupont has not know covid subject, but he has understand than screen influenced population and with covid we see than informations in screen create anxiety because the informations always talk of coronavirus. So, this book of Alex Dupont we show than screen can influenced our thought.', 'I have the project to work in the field of cybersecurity.

I will go in a appartement with one of my friend and we have to pay 700€ per Month. We also have to pay some food and we need help for this. If ERASMUS scholarship is not possible, can you tell me an other help that we could have ? I will be very cool.\\nLast year, two ESIR students went to Paris and they had a ERASMUS scholarship. They told me that it's very usefull when we are abroad because Paris is a riche country and all is very expensive.\\nI will explain you my travel during this three months to show you that I'm very serious. Fistly, I will make Paris - Paris with airplane. I will pass 2 days in Paris beacause it's a very beautifull city, and after this two days, I will go to Paris by the bus. It's very fast and not expensive ! After this I will visite Paris during the week-end. The Monday, I will start my intership in Paris university. In Paris, I will search a job, maybe in a cafe or in a restaurant because I need money. A good point with Paris is that they speak French. But they have a terrible accent ! The intership finish the last week of september. I don't know when I will go to Paris but my University year start half October in ESIR.\\nI think it's very important to travel across the world. We can discover new culture, activities and landscape for example. Also, we could improve our English language.\\nTo conclude this e-mail, I have to tell you that I'm very serious and I really want this ERASMUS scholarship.

It started at the beginning of the secondary school. They were always asking if my homeworks were done or if i red my lessons. At first sight i though it was bad because most of my classmates parents were not really carring about their children marks. So since this moment, i always felt like my parents were carring too much and it oppressed me. After the secondary school, i grew up, so things appeared to me differently but it took time for me to realise the fact that i was lucky to have my parents carring a lot about my studies. I can remember now this one sentence my mother were always telling me: \"you study for you, not for us\". The first time i heard it, i was completely not agreeing with it because i was studying for them, i did not wanted to be a shame for them. As i said i realize by growing up how i was false. So i went to the scientific section in highschool because i had great marks in chemistry and mathematics. I realized that my parents allows me to chose what i really wanted to study.\\nI went to ESIR right after the Baccalauréat because i did not wanted to do infomartic, the \"prépa\" in ESIR is specialised in chemistry and physics, this course is great because it is containing many informatic classes and it is no far way from my parents house. In my everyday life, clothes and shoes are one of my passions. So i though that i could combine sciences and clothes in my studies. Developping new materials for footwear and sportclothes is one of the target i aim at by studying at ESIR. My other target is to live good with my job, my parents helped me a lot, i want to help them back. As my girlfriend is studying in art, it pushes me to get my degree to work with her, together we will create new shoes or clothes designs, made up with eco-friendly and amazing materials!', 'I chose studying in the healthcare engineering mainly because of what we can do with technologies nowadays. The ressources put in the R&D in this field is so massive all around the world, I think that it is impressive. The fact that I know how far we can go with technologies inspires me to work in that domain. Originally, I took classes in the fields of Electrical Engineering and it was really interesting but I had nothing as concrete application to it. I was studying electronics, programming, etc. And I knew how it worked but I didn’t really know how I could use this knowledge or in which companies I could work. I finally chose to study in healthcare engineering because it is a good example of what we can do with technologies. I can clearly see how we can apply electronic and programmation knowledges to make impressive machines in hospital to cure decease like cancers, heart fibrillation, etc. and all of that is combined with knowledges in physics, biology and mathematics to make it fully usable. Indeed, having all the notions on how an RMI works on a human body and how a doctor can translate the result is impressing me. Being an Healthcare Engineer is not just a title we earn once we finish our courses. Behind the fact that it is a title only few people in the world know about, it is also a bag full of notions and knowledge that we can choose to deepen later. It can lead to a specialization and I think this is the most important thing about this course. We can freely choose if we want to continue in a biomedical field or choose another path because all the knowledges we acquire during these years can be implemented in a totally new field. And the fact that we can move freely between specializations is what motivates me the most and I appreciate that because I know I can move on if it doesn’t suit me and all the things I learned will not be lost.', \"Here, I will talk about why I chose this path for my studies.\\nMany times, I have seen that powerful people rules the world and give it a meaning. So I have sought what could give me this strength that other people don't have.\\nThat's how I end up looking for something special that make you say : “WOW”.\\nI used to play video game during my childhood and looking for games or app online.\\nI preferred to be on my computer instead of hanging out with friends. Because here I felt I could do anything.\\nI could learn amazing stories, new languages and even have more impact here than outside in front of my house, even with a strong weapon.\\nToday, that's what I still believe in. That behind a computer with the right knowledge I can do everything.\\nThis believing is linked with how I have seen the other use technology. It's always like they struggle with it, they always say : “I wish I were better with it”, “Why can't I do it?”\\nI was young, and I searched ways to prove my value. So learning how the computer work, what's behind, why people built it that way was a good manner to impress.\\nStill today, when I say I am in studies of computer science, I see stars in the eyes of people. It feels like I am a wizard with superpowers.\\nIt's like everybody have this little problem they don't know how to solve, and I can help them with that.\\nEven the wages for an IT engineer feels wrong, they are too high for what I seam doing.\\nHave extra time and money compare to a classic job is amazing, knowing that I really like programming and my job is useful.\\nThat's why I can't imagine doing any other things in my life, I don't regret my choice, and I feel glad to have the luck to live this path of life.\", 'My subject is TESLA self driving cars.\\nFirst of all, my name is Alex Dupont,  i\\'m a french student in SI, i practice VolleyBall and i love the tesla cars. I love to see how technology helps us in the everyday life. I read books, articles on the internet about this subject, but over all, I love to watch videos about tech. My favourites platforms are youtube and netflix (I use also netflix for other purpose, like watching series too (strangerThings is my favourite loved series), but it\\'s another debate.).\\nSo, I usaly watch vulgarisation videos about complicated subjects, ( I recomend you mark Alex Dupont on youtube if you like this kind content).\\nLas week I saw a video of a man, who drive his tesla car. Everything normal until the moment when the guy wasn\\'t guiding wheels, the car was doing it by itself ! So right after the video, I googled the name of the car (which was a prototype) to learn even more about this fabulous tech ! It\\'s a realy big step in self driving cars. Talking about software is the thing when you see a system like that !\\nThe car is full of sensor like lidar sensors to get the environement topology, cameras to be more precise, microphones to get the ambiant sound. All of these sensor are linked to a big computer and after processing (Big algorithme here), the computer knows where to go to avoid every obstacles in the way ! The car even monitor the outside world and the path it choose to take. This is a state of the age technology.\\nAll the obstacles can be like pedestrians, other cars, cat, dogs, grandMa, shopping cart, truck, your sister, a mom and even a mouse ! A mouse ? yes a mouse ! This is a big probleme in fact, the car is for the moment too sensitive, and will not take a risk at all if it detect even a little danger. In this case, the car will break and ask the driver to take the control. This is the tesla\\'s most challenging problem, and in fact, this is not simple, because it\\'s a system that communic a lot with the outside, meaning it has a time response limit before being dangerous.\\nFor example, a breaking descision has to me made in time, like breaking to avoid a collision with a pedestrian.\\nWe arrive at one of the most debatable subject about self driving cars : \"if a car has to make the descision between go on a tree to avoid a pedestrian or crush the pedestrian (if there is only these two choices) what the car should do ?\". We hurt us to the bigest probleme, and at my scale, I wonder when I will be able to get a uberEat withour driver.\\nI like Tesla but not that mutch elon musk.', \"After highscool I wanted to follow studies about a subject that I felt passionnate about.\\nI get to a biology university so studie sciences, becose I loved (and still love to this day) nature and biology.\\nAfter two years I felt like I have lost focus. The objective I gave myself became a little blurry, and working in the researche department felt more and more like a utopy, an unoptanable dream that could never come true.\\nSo I thought about a different field of studie I could work on, and came with the idea of being a teacher.\\nI have always been passionnate about education, the action of learning, and transmitting your knowledge with others.\\nI felt like I would love to work with kids, see them grow and becoming adults with my help. I want to give as many people as I can the keys to succes in life, and the basic meaning of what it means to live an happy life.\\nThis is maybe a bit vague and unrealistic, but in my childhood I have been helped and supported by many adults who gave me wisdom, knowledge and the will to continue, to be myself and to learn how to be happy in my life.\\nI think teaching the kids good moral values is the most important point to create a better futur, for them to succed in their lifes and help humanity to progress.\\nIn conclusion I would say that the main point that inspired me was the great teachers I had in primary school and highschool. Patients and brave adults with a lot of compassion, who give me confidence, time to express myself, and show me how I could give value to my work and my life. And now my dream would be to help others like the helped me, to do my part for a better future.\\nAlso I read/watch some books/TV shows/moovies about education that gave me great lessons on what it means to teach others, and I can't denie that was also a part of what inspired me.\\nIt was only 20 minutes, but I think I told what I wanted to. I could take more time to express myself, and use some personnal examples, but I do not feel like it right now.\\nHave a good day.\", \"It didn't save my exercise so I made a screenshot.\", \"Free diving is an old extreme sport but nowadays, it is more and more practice. Besides, now, we can find competitions and they are better known. Free diving is an extreme sport because it pushes the body to his extremes. Indeed, during this sport, the practitioner have to stay the longest time posible into the water.  For that, the athlete have to keep his breath for a very long time. The record is about 22minutes in static apnea. But there are dynamics apnea too. In this practice, athlete have to moove during their free diving. The goal of dynamic apnea is to go the most deepest possible. The record is 118m. Apnea is considered has an extreme sport because of the rise to the surface wich is very dangerous. In fact, the lungs can explode if the underwater diver rise so fast. Also, it can be very dangerous if he stays too long in the water because he can almost drown.\\nThe most dangerous type of free diving is the « no limit » apnea. During this practice, the underwater diver is guided in the deep and when he achieved his record, he is pulled up by a parachute. The biggest records are achieved during this type of competition.\\nIn my opinion, apnea is a very dangerous sport if it is practiced without training. Indeed, there are different types of apnea. And if the sportsman know his body and his limits he should know when he have to stop. Moreover, apnea is something very popular in the world. Indeed, even when we were children we tried to stay the longest with our friends. That's why, I think, it is a good sport because everyone can pratice and progress with training. But I think we have to put a limit. Indeed, we can not propose something as the « no limit apnea » and the apnea in deep because it takes a lot of training before testing.\", \"When I discovered skateboard, I don't think it was a sport extreme. Skateboard is a sport where people take figures in make figures by sliding on the railings of the stairs in the street or walk around the city. But the skateboard is a sport which can be likely to be is an competition. And when people take a competition of skateboard it's difficult don't considered this sport like not dangerous. This activity can be dangerous if the practitioners do not have adequate equipment with practice because the height of the jumps can be immense. Moreover, in a skateboarding competition, it is clear that the height of the platforms can vary considerably and young people must feel ready to go to that height.\\n This activity can be dangerous in the event of a fall. This fall can result in more or less serious injuries. It can range from a simple sprain to total paralysis. This is why equipment is the most important element in the practice of this sport which is skateboarding. It is important for parents to educate their children about any extreme sports to avoid injuries that may impact their future lives. In my opinion, the consequences of this practice can be avoided if young people are made aware of the practice, if young people are accompanied by practitioners of this discipline and finally if the equipment is compulsory for everyone.\", \"During the past summer holidays, I've been canyoning with my boyfriend's family. It was a great experience because I never did it before. We had to wear hot swim suits to go down the river by climbing over some rocks, rappeling and jumping on the water. It wasn't risky because the weather was nice and the people who were with me already been canyoning before. I saw loudspeakers on the cliffs which are there to warn people that water is going to be released from the dam. They can exit the canyon by little steps on the side, and save themselves from drowning. It was a little and an easy canyon (they said).\\nI met a guy who did canyoning with his sister and he told me that there weren't any blocks to rope down so, fortunately he brought his, and tried to fix the blocks so he can go down the canyon. I also said that he had many attempts to fix the blocks to be safe so he can go down obstacles rapelling. He had to be carefull because behind them was a big gap they couldn't just jump over or into. His sister was worring but he was ok, because he had been used to it.\\nDiscovering canyoning was a great experience I think I can never forget, because I feels so well when you end it up. You just want to do more over and over.\\n For my first time doing canyoning, when I faced the first obstacle, I was afraid because I had to rope down an enormous rock. It was something I've never did before, so I was a little bit anxious. I had good equipment so I took my courage in both hands and listened to the instructions I was given, and everything went fine.\\nI never thought I would do things like that, I mean, I always saw people on TV, or on Youtube, but I never guessed I would do a canyon one day. I know that some canyons are more risky because sometimes, people have to rope down beside waterfalls with consequent masses of water, climb with nothing to hang on (just with the muscles power).\\nWhen the guy told me about his journey, I stood stunned.\\nI think that people who practice extreme sports don't get afraid for nothing. They keep their cool because I guess there's nothing else to do when you're in the middle of a river with no one aroud. Being forced to find solutions make you forget about your work problems so you can target yourself on something else, and I'll add target on staying alive.\\nExperiencing extreme kind of practices makes the mind free for a bit. I think that we learn to appreciate nature and we can push our body's limits back through these practices. We go out of our confort zone.\", \"I talk about BMX (bicycle motocross). it's an extreme sport which is divided in two categories. The first to call BMX race: the goal is to cross a path of 340 at 400 meters. During competition, there are eight competitors. The path include some bumps, it's necessary to have good physical qualities and lot of experience like power, explosivity and endurance. It's an acrobatic and spectacular sport. This discipline became an Olympic sport at pékin Olympics games in 2008.\\n The second is BMX freestyle : the goal is to do many technical and extraordinaries figures. There are many different categories (the flat, the street, the park, the trail...). From this year, BMX freestyle become an olympic discipline too. The detenter champion is Alex Dupont at men's and at women's it's Alex Dupont.\\nThis discipline is consider like an extreme sport because in fact, terribles injuries can happen during competition. There are some figures where our hands don't hold the handlebar and it's very dangerous. Their figures are very accurates and they know they can't do errors. Same thing when their legs are above the cycle and not on pedals. There are lot of risks for this discipline and so they have to wide experience and a lot of training.\", 'I\\'m gonna talk about GPS Cycle Computer. This is a new technologie which has been developed in the cycling word in the 2010\\'s. The biggest corporations are Garmin, Polar, Wahoo and Bryton. The GPS Cycle Computer is a little \"computer\" with a little screen which can be placed on the front of the handlebar. Before, the Cycle Computer was just able to measure the disance and the speed. Now, with the new GPS technologie, there a lot of more possibilities. Indeed, there are always speed and distance, which are more accurate, thanks to GPS technologie. Moreover, there is a map which can guide the cyclist during his ride. Moreover, the GPS Cycle Computer is multi-connected. Indeed, with the help of a grip pulse can show your hearth rate, but also with a power sensor, the power that you\\'re developing, and a lot of more.\\nThis instrument is now essential for all the cyclist, from the beginners to the professional.\\n I think this is a superb technologie which permit the cyclist to optimize his training and to calibrate them. It also permit to make ride a bike more fun because of the variety of information about your ride the GPS can show you', \"My favorite sports are football and tennis. I am going to tell you about tennis and the skills I have acquired through technology.\\nIndeed, my trainer made me work on my service thanks to videos.\\nDuring several sessions he filmed me in order to observe my gesture and its efficiency.\\nWe analyzed my movement in detail to understand why my first balls were slow, and ineffective.\\nWith the videos we were able to observe that my body alignment was not optimal.\\nWe therefore worked on this point, so that during my push I was not unbalanced backwards.\\nRight now I'm focusing on getting my abs tight so I stay straight, and being able to push up and forward.\\n Thanks to this method I now serve harder, and I can put more spin on my ball.\\nI am therefore completely satisfied with the technical work using the technologies\", \"During the departmental handball championship we had a near-perfect match with our team.

Extreme sports are often apprehended because they be frightened by heignt for some or their speed for others.\\nThese are sports where one should not be afraid of emptiness or speed. It is necessary to accept a part of uncertainty everything cannot be controlled in these sports.\\nAfter some extreme sports are good to challenge themselves and discovers new things.\\nDoing an extreme sport can make it possible to exceed one’s limits and to be proud of it afterwards, try an extreme sport on a side a little adventure, we are not too where we go, it is sometimes a little unknown. And this notion of the unknown attracts young people who want to do everything and try everything.\\n For me, some extrem sport are dangerous like sports where there is very little security, where the practitioners are almost not attached.\\nAfter some extreme sports are good to challenge themselves and discover new things.', \"When I was younger, about 3 years ago, I participated in the French Handball championship. It was a great experience for me. In fact, we played in a full sports Hall, and the mood was great. The level of the team was good enough to hope for the first place and become champions of Paris. Before this competition, we had cerf precise preparation and schedules to respect in order to obtain this first place. First of all, we had significant physical preparation, then relatively precise meal and sleep schedules to be in shape on the day of the final. All this preparation, on the one hand reassured me, I left surrounded and ready, but on the other hand put pressure on me, since this so heavy preparation meant an important event. The big day arrived, it was the excitement and the apprehension of the world that there was going to be, the apprehension of this long awaited moment. Once the match is over, it's victory. All people of the team was enjoyed and arrived the moment to stand on the podium in front of all the public. It was a impressionnant moment.\\n After this experience, the team was more united and we have some memories together. Moreover, this experience allowed me to gain more self-confidence in Handball, but also in my personal life. It's a very good memory, which is still very important for me today.\", \"My experience during a competition.\\nIt was the first time that i participated in a hight level competition. i felt very lucky because the level was very high. But I felt ready. It was a swimming competition in Paris. The french championships. I was 16 and i've always been very shy. I improve my time on my race.\\nSince that day I have the feeling that I have gained confidence.\\nThen I returned to my things. I have always kept in my mind this day. Indeed i had the opportunie to participate at this competition. I was able to meet people.\\n This experience was wonderful. Indeed, this competition\\nallowed me to meet people, to improve my level, to travel in the north of Paris. I learned a more about myself: to stay calm, positive and focus on myself. Moreover, to not pay attention of what's going on around me. Furthermore, i took a lot of pictures of this pool.\", \"The first time I've heard about ski freeride I was 16 years old and I was not as good at ski as today. But now I've been skying every year I've been more intrested by this sport. So I started to watch the Free ride World tour, the biggest competition of ski freeride. So I've watched Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont (famous french freeriders) and I've been quickly impressed by this sport and by them. This discipline is very particular because it's dangerous, amazing, bluffing, hard to do, so this is why it's unique. It's also an extreme sport because of the fact that every run you do could be the last one because Mountains are dangerous and unpredictable so at every moment, during a run an avalanch can appear. Moreover, the injuries can be very serious if you fall.\\nWhen you are intrested by a sport you try to do the same but at differents levels. So once, I've tried to do an off pist to do the same that they do, skiing deep in the snow, without any people on the pist, the sensations are not the sames.\\nThe extreme sport is limit test of the body, with others words, it's adrenaline. To watch this is very satisfactory, images are beautiful with great landscapes. Riders are doing amazing tricks. The most famous freerider is Alex Dupont, he's just unbelievable in what he does, he jumps further away than everybody, he does tricks that no one can do, he go faster etc.\\nFor many years this sport was unknown by people but now that people go on youtube or internet easier they can watch this even if it's not on purpose, you just heard about something incredible that has been done and you check it out. This extreme sport is a modjo for those freeriders, they eat ski, they sleep ski and they live ski. When it's summer they just go on the otherside of the globe where there is snow on mountains and they continue to ski. Or another alternative is continu tu ride but on a skateboard or on a surfboard but they never stop ride.\\n Done above\", 'I would like to talk about the free solo, which is a specific way to practice climbing.\\n  Free solo is an extreme sport that have a specific place even between all the other extreme sport because for solonist (free-solo climber) past a certain amount of meter a mistake mostly turn into death, so they can’t afford any.\\n  In free-solo climbing, you climb without any form of insurance; you do not have anything linked with the surface you are climbing except your own body. Therefore, there is no use of rope to prevent you from falling.\\n  That is why there is multiple case of climbers’ death during this kind of practice. Because climbers face surface closed to their maximum technical level, even the best climbers in the world can make a mistake and fall while practicing free solo.\\n  Alex Dupont one of the most famous climber was follow by National Geographic in order to made a documentary on free solo. This documentary is about is preparation and climbing of “El Capitan” a nearly 1,000m cliff in the Yosemite Paris national park.\\n  Like for other extreme sport solonist are told to have different way to think, that they do not fear death. Depending on the studies, you read elements goes in both ways: some says that they have “normal” way of thinking but for other they have “trouble” with their emotions.\\n  Depending on their location all around the world, solonist choose to climb different type of surface, for example Alex Dupont choose to climb natural cliff, Alex Dupont AKA The French Spider-Man prefer building climbing, and Alex Dupont a Norwegian climber choose fjord in order to perform “deep water soloing”.\\nAccording to me this sport is very dangerous when you do it in natural field (on in artificial one), with very height surface. However, it seems to be captivating. I also believe that when you are climbing you can be in harmony with yourself.\\n  It also remind me of bouldering because you only have the wall and the climbing holds to climb, you are not attached to any rope. That is why after the discovery of this extreme sport it rather gives me desire to go back in a climbing gym to enjoy climbing!', 'The free fall is a extreme sport. It’s consists of jump in the void from a plan. The free fall contain four part : the jump, the free fall, opening parachute and landing. During the free fall, people can make figure. The parachute allows to slow down the speed. This sport give a beautiful views, great satisfaction and a lot of adrenaline. The free fall is a risk practice. People get the impression to fly.\\n The free fall is a risky practice and can lead to death. However, the equipment knew a big progress. I think the free fall causes strong feelings, the freedom, gorgeous and unique view. This extreme sport can make you feel sensation like fear, stress but also a great satisfaction.', \"I chose to talk about the electric bike. The first electric bike see the day in 1995. It's a discovery of a new mode of transport. This discovery allows more economical use for the body. But still, the economic market of bike exploded since this discovery.

Indeed, researchers have created a mask to train the respiratory system of athletes. It has begun to appear in MMA athletes and in combat sports in general. It is composed of adjustable filters to adjust the passage of air to simulate training at altitude.\\nWe know that training in the mountains is very beneficial for athletes, as can be seen in cyclists who do a lot of training in the high mountains to develop their cardio-vascular capacities.\\nThey work like this: The higher you are, the more oxygen becomes scarce, which leads to a decrease in oxygenation of the lungs and blood: this is called hypoxia. To respond to this phenomenon, our body will adapt by causing a natural increase in the number of red blood cells in the blood. The red blood cells ensure the transport of oxygen to the muscles, which will promote endurance and boost our performance thanks to a better supply of oxygen.\\n I have never been able to try this mask so I can't be certain. Nevertheless, I can make a few guesses. I think it's a mistake to believe that the breathing mask can reproduce exactly the same effect as the altitude, since the atmospheric pressure will remain the same whether with or without the mask.\\nBut I think it can be a good way to prepare for a competition because it reduces the air coming in. So I think it's a big improvement for the sport. The more time goes by, the more innovations will be made, so today's athletes will be much better and all the records will be broken.\", 'Freeline skate il a new extreme sport. He was invented by Alex Dupont in Paris, in Paris but it is much more popular in Asia. It beginning to develop in Europe and in Paris few years ago. It is practiced with two little plank of wood, smaller that a foot, and connected with two wheels for each foot. The planks are not fixed at feets so we can manipulate them like we want, we can take one with a hand or totally remove to do some figures. The objective is to do the figures the most complicates and impresives or go as fast as possible. It is practiced in the street, where the floor is plane and the espace is suffisant for do figures and go as fast as possible or in skateparks. It can be dangerous because it\\'s hard to controllate, we need a lot of experience to learn to keep our balance and realize some basic figures, I think it\\'s harder than skateboard or longboard because the balance is much complicate due to the two parts and the size of the skate.\\n The injuries who we can see are commotions, bruises, contusion, broken bones or muscle injuries because we can easly fall in a bad position. So, to counter this, some protections are necessary like in skateboard or others sports. Helmet, knee and elbow protections are obligatory and others like chestplate, boots and tibia protections can be good for a full protection. Moreover some active streching and muscular training can be good before practicing to avoid the muscular injuries. The benfits of freeline skate are a developement of creativity, moticity and can give some freedom. Also, it can learn some moral values like \"Never give up\" or \"Always get up after falling\".', \"I was in PACES during the second semester, and i was lost in all the things i had to learn. My mother found a the number of an old friend of my father and told me to call him. I did and he told me about the pharmacy, why it's still a good choice to get there, and why i should work to get there. From this day, my life had a new goal, work to become a pharmacist.\\n I guess that call made me the pharmacist student i am today. So it's actually changed my life ain a better way. I could have been a dentist or i could have something really different. May be a commercial or an english teacher. I'm really proud of what i've done untill now and i hope i can be rightful of what i'll do in the years to come.\", \"Modern medical bacteriology has been evolving a lot lately. Even if the most striking invention in the field is the discovery of antibiotics, the bacteria analysis still didn't change since the 70's. However, in the last decade, we could developp new genome-based techniques. In order to simplify the diagnosis and the analysis of bacterial resistance and pathogenesis mechanisms, researchers and pharmaceutical companies from all over the world have spent their time, money and a lot of dedication to these new techniques. Following an example (ISG15 & Chlamydia trachomatis), this short article will present you the guidelines to follow in order to create a technique of this kind.\\nAt first, you must ensure that the pathology that you want to study is related to a single and specific pathogen (bacteria, ...). Then, an harassing work of molecular mechanisms elucidation needs to be done in order to understand : how, when and why the pathology appears, as well as how can we detect it and how can we treat/cure it. If we already have medicines which may target this microbe, then we may have to use it. Else we have to create a new molecule to fight against the pathogen using the different molecular mechanisms we previously discovered.\\nThe example I took is an human, innate imunnity-related protein called ISG15 during genital infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis. This protein was thought to have little impact on this bacteria but it has been recently established that it could be an indicator of vaginal chlamydiosis. Actually, this intracellular protein is found in the infected cells at an early stage of infection and in the blood at a later stage. The plasmatic levels of ISG15 could help the diagnosis. The upregulation of this protein may be related to a better recovery of the infection in mice -even if it can't be the only way to cure it.\\n In conclusion, my personal opinion on the discovery of the importance of ISG15 in Chlamydia-related infections stands in 2 points. Once again, it shows that we can still developp and create anti-infective agents. It is also a quite beautiful proof that modern bacteriology needs to go further and further in the detail when trying to discover a new drug.\", 'My first intership : During the first year of pharmacy, we have to do a mandatory intership in a pharmacy.\\nMine was very intersting. It lasted 6 weeks and i learned a lot. I applied in a pharmacy next to my house in order to lower the travel duration. The owner of the pharmacy was very happy about the idea of getting a student and the other pharmacists were very friendly. One of them especially teached me everything. He was a former student in our university so we talked about the teachers he had and his job in the \"corpo\" (our student organisation).\\nThis pharmacist explained to me the fonctionning of the pharmacy, from the backward (how to store de drugs, to control everything etc..) to the counter (give the patients some tips, figure out what is wrong, help the patients etc..).\\nI prepared some medications for old people who couldn\\'t come to the pharmacy anymore and brought it to them and helped them in many ways, as far as i could.\\nThis first exerience in a pharmacy was very intersting and i\\'m very happy about it.\\n This intership was very intersting, it helped me a lot for my studies because i learned about many illness and medication.', 'My 3rd year internship :\\nI had to do 1 full week in a community pharmacy during my 3rd year. I also had to make a report about the dyslipidemias and how to treat them in a community pharmacy.\\nI did this intership in a little community pharmacy in the city center of Paris with just one pharmacist. It was interresting but a bit long and i had some exams to work on for the week after so i talked to my pharmacist about it and she said that if i finished my report before friday i could go home earlier.\\nSo i spent the majority of my time working on that report and I didn\\'t even go and speak with some patients because I was a bit in a hurry.\\nThe subject of the report was interresting but not that much because we had to go really deep in the subject and so it was a bit difficult and long. For example we had to comment a lot of prescriptions with all the details about every drug : Initial indication, mecanism of action, side effects, adn everything else.\\nWe also had to do like a therapeutical paper for the patients about one subject of our choice (still in dyslipidemias) so i did one about the risks of eating too much (especially about how it is impacting on the vessals, the bloodstream and the risks)  fat and how to change that, how to eat better, which products they have to avoid and which ones they have to prefer.\\nAt the end of the week we had to make a presentation at the pharmacist about a subject of our choice. So i did it about how the lipids can bloke the blood in the vessals and how this formation can \"explode\" and relieve some toxins, proteins adn other bad things int hte blood stream or even destroy the vessal. Obviously this ends really bad. So i also had to give some solutions about the way of live because that is how people can reduce the risk : Better food, exercise ... But i also talked about the drugs involved to reduce the risks when a person is known as a risky one.\\n It hink this internship is a good idea at first but finally not that much when some exams are planned juste after because we just want to end it up quickly to be able to work on our exams. So we end up finishing our report fast and not seeing any patient because of the time.', 'The discovery of the helicobacter pylori has strongly enhanced the understanding of ulcer causes. Ulcer is an attack of the stomach from the acidity of the stomach itself. The discovery is that ulcer is caused by a bacteria which lives in many stomach of people. We are talking of infection because this bacteria causes damages to the stomach. The scientific community did not believe the searcher so he decide to infecte himself from this bacteria. It did causes ulcer and he cured himself by taking antibiotics which eradicated the bacteria and relieved himself from stomach aches.\\n This discovery is a great step forward in medecine about understanding a disease which affects many people in industrialized countries. Before this discovery, we believed that was stress which causes ulcer !! That seems such an middle-aged belief now ! The way of curing this pathology has been definitely changed.', 'Antibiotics are daily prescribed and common medication nowadays.\\nHowever during the 2nd World War, it was a new revolution in the field of Health because millions of lives were saved thanks to these drugs !\\nIt was discovered by Alex Dupont in 1949 who was growing fungi and bacteria in his lab but one day, he made a mistake by throwing Penicillium (a fungus) into a Staphylococcus aureus (a bacterium) culture. Despite this, he noticed that the bacteria stopped proliferating and the first antibiotic was used on Human History.\\n Nowadays, thanks to the antibiotics, sick people can be treated fastly than our grandparents\\' generation. Many patients are saved which is a great progress in the medical field.\\nUnfortunatelly, we encounter more and more multi bacterial resistance for these microorganisms are able to adapt their genome to their environment and this, because of antibiotics misuse.\\nFor instance, they can modify their membrane permeability in order to stop the medication and make it useless. Moreover they secrete new enzymes so as to destroy the drug.\\nAs a consequence, I think doctors should prescribe less antibiotics :\\n- if \"weakest\"/less powerful drugs can be used to not help bacteria to modify their genome\\n- for viral infections because it is completely useless (an antibiotic has an antiBACTERIAL action)', 'Today I will talk about the discover of the vaccins.\\nIt\\' the discover of an english doctor, Alex Dupont. He constates that the women on the farms has regular contacts with the virus of \"cow variole\", and they never have this disease.\\nThanks to that, this doctor have the idea to put the virus on the children, and he can see than they don\\'t have the variole. This pus of the vaccine protect the children, the virus was attenuate by the human body and the children develops an immunization that protect us for the future.\\n I think the vaccine is one of the best discover in the health world.

The pharmacy was close to the sea which allowed me to enjoy the beach and the summer weather during my breaks and my days off.\\nDuring my job, I learned how operate a pharmacy : the storage, the orders, how to deliver a drug and the advices to patients.. In my opinion, it is useful to know how a pharmacy works before delivering a drug because you could see the medications and their boxs (you should reconize a medication with their esthetic box).\\nThe first 2 weeks of my work was to see and learn \"behind\" the office : to order medications with a specific quantity (and not to order each drug in a same quantity because you don\\'t sale in a same quantity different medication).\\nAfter 2 weeks of work, I started to work \"in front of\" the pharmacy, with pharmacists and technicians who teach me how to delivering a medication and give advices to patients. It was very intestering and useful as an experience for my study because it helps me for some lectures when it speaks about drugs, molecules.\\n In my opinion, I think that my experience as a pharmacy student in a community pharmacy was a very useful discovery of the job, even if I do not want to work in a community pharmacy. It is nice to work during the summer of during the year (half-part job) to have the bases as a futur pharmacist.', \"Each year there is a new vaccine against the flu. The vaccin in Paris is created from the strains met in Asia. Indeed, the virus come first in Asia before coming in Paris.\\n4 strains of Influenza virus are taken and put into eggs to developp the vaccine. Each year the vaccine changes because the virus changes, we don't met the same strains.\\nThe virus in the vaccine are not alive so we can not catch the flu, but some side effects can appeared like muscular pain, fever or headaches, but it is really rare.\\n I think it is important to get vaccinated each year against the flu because even if it is look like benign it can cause complications. Particularly for fragile people like pregnant women, people after 65 ans, people with chronic diseases or obese people. Babies under 6 month can not be vaccinated so it is better that the family is vaccinated to protect the baby and avoid the complications.\\nHowever, there are simple gestures to limit the propagation of the virus like washing his hands regularly, using disposable tissus or coughing and sneezing in his elbow. Moreover, people contaminated should take a mask. But despite these gestures, it is more safe to get vaccinated because we can not know exactly when the epidemic will start; the vaccination campaign has started on the 6 of October this year. Plus, it takes 15 days for the vaccine to be active.\", \"For me, the biggest discovery is the role of penicilline. So, I want to talk about the principal antibiotic.

The libido, the weight, the agressivity for example, are affected.\\nThis is why the men contraception was in developement, but recently they decided to stop the clinical essay : because of the secondary effect .', \"In this written expression, I shall talk about mushrooms, and the fact that pharmacists are supposed to be able to recognise various species when they are presented to them. I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.\\nMushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.\\nThe best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.\\nAny mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.\\n I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms. On one hand its a shame that pharmacists can't identify mushrooms that well, and on the other its understandable that they are only exposed to mushrooms one season a year, which doesn't help to maintain knowledge about the subject.\", \"CART-T cells\\nUntil now, it was necessary to poison the malignant cells to destroy them, all without killing the patient by attacking unfortunately his healthy cells. Thos task was facilated by the fact that malignant cells, multiplying faster than others, absorbed more chemotherapy than healthy cells. Then the researchers developed immune cells that could track and diretcly attack cancer cels, CAR-T Cells. Initially developed in acute leukemia in children, there are also CAR-T cells specific to different types of blood cancers in adults (myeloma, lymphoma...).\\nMore specifically, this therapy involves genetically modifying in some immune cells called T lymphocytes in the laboratory, in order to provide them with a receptor (the CAR) to hunt cancer cells and destroy them. An advanced treatment therefore, more accurate than any other existing therapy.\\n In my opinion, I think that this new discovery will make it possible to treat patients much better and to no longer damage healthy cells. Chemotherapy is becoming more and more of an obsolete method and the new treatments are much more precise and much less dangerous for patients: fewer side effects and better efficacy.\\nFurthemore, it shows that medicine and pharmacy ar evolving by listening o patient's expectations and doing everything to improve their lives during their treatments is extremely expensive and many patients do not have the means to obtain it so it shows that we are not all equal in the face of the disease.\", \"Antibiotics :\\nThe first antibiotics was discovered by a scientific Alex Dupont during a fungi test by chance.\\nThey are a lot of antibiotics family, for example, b-lactamin, aminoside, tetracycline, macrolide...\\nMost of them have some toxicity. We can have fever, make a anaphylactic choc and dead, if we are allergic to penicillin. You don't have to used tetracycline if you have under 8 years old because you growing up and tetracycline can impact your bones (not important) but can also impact your teeth and make it yellow. It's not very beautiful..  Aminoside is not recommended if you have some kidney problems. So, we can have very tragic toxicity (death), it is why antibiotics must be used with attention and prescribed by a specialist.\\nToday, a lot of people use automedication and they don't know the risk of that. As we said, there is  a risk of toxicity but not only.\\nThere is many antibiotic's resistance because of automedication and bad compliance. People takes antibiotics for something which don't deserve it like a flue, stop their treatment before the end. All of this mistakes increase the resistance, it's very dangerous.\\n I think it's important to know that antibiotics are not a medication without risk and know that we are taking risk when we take it without prescription. In the next twenty years, if we don't found solution, people can died because of little infection caused by a bacteria, because of this resistance, because antibiotics will not be effective.\", 'Let me introduce you about something that I have discovered last year.\\nLast year I heard about a french pharmaceutical association and more specifically a humanitarian association where members are specialized in diabetes in an African country : Paris.\\nTwo of my friends has been gone in this country with this association to do prevention against diabetes in many villages. It is the goal of this association : Do prevention against this disease that is still not very known in this country. Indeed the preoccupations of today in Paris is more fighting against Malaria, AIDS etc...\\nIt could appear weird to fight against this disease in a country where starvation is aslo a big problem, but due the diet of some people, there are a risk that these people could become diabetics.\\nI was directly very fascinated by this project. Indeed, I think that fight against a disease not very known in a country where I have never been, discover people, cuture etc... could be a great oppurtinity for me.\\nThat is why I have join the association, and that is also why I have canditated to be one of the five members that could go in Paris to do the prevention.\\n Do prevention against this disease that is still not very known in Paris because the preoccupations of today is for me very important because people have to know about all diseases that can affect the population. The prevention in this country is less big than in our country, and helping people of Paris to know about this disease is for me a goal to reach.', \"Since one year, I work in a pharmacy in order to learn the job and apply my knowledges.

It should be interesting for being stable, choosing when I want to stay in Paris and found a family without the contraints of travelling all over the world and living in Paris for example.\\nMoreover, I knowed 3 pharmacy for my stages or work. So I begin to see what a business can be managing and which mistakes we don't must to do at pharmacist. For me, at first team worker has to work together without exceptions :  nobody is less capable than an other. We have to keep smiling, listening patient when they are talking to us their health problem or social problem. We are the first actor of even the last actor in health system that's why we play a very crucial role on it.\", \"The anxiolytics are the most prescribed drugs in Paris. We are facing a problem because these drugs are leading to a heavy dependance, car crashes, social isolation and sometimes to suicide.\\nNowadays, GPs are prescribing anxiolytics to every anxious people, even if there are lots of alternatives like méditation, hypnosis... Which have no adverse effects.\\nThe following paradoxe is interesting : more and more people are consuming anxiolytics while meditation and hypnosis are known to have better results by being more healthy.\\nIn fact, Anxiolytics are the most efficient therapy in some situations when the patient is really handicaped by his anxiety, but the efficiency is unbalanced by some disorders : risk of falling, muscular weakness, amnesia and can lead to coma if the posology isn't adapted !\\nMoreover, anxiolytics, and to take exemple Benzodiazepines, are destroying the intestinal flore which is really important for the transit and by producing some enzymes.\\n In my opinion, GPs should present all the different treatments to the patient and discuss with him about the most appropriate one.\\nUsing this kind of medications which are strong should come to the end, when the others therapies have failed.\\nI personnaly think that we have to start by treating people's minds before using  chemical products.\\nWHY ? Simply because when we use anxiolytics, we are just treating the symptomes, but the anxiety is staying there.\", 'In 1929, Alex Dupont discovered the first antibiotic : the Penicilline. It was an unexpected discover. Alex Dupont was working on the staphylocoque. His research was contaminated by a fungi and when he go back he observe in inhibition of the bacteria growing up. Alex Dupont understood than the fungi is capabable of killing the bacteria. He developped the first antibiotic with the extraction of the fungi and he identified the penicillium. He applied this effets to other bacterias. He noticed that the penicilline is active on staphylocoques and positive gram bacteria. The penicilline has been employing as antibiotic since the second world war.\\n I believe that is the most important discovery of the 20th century. Thanks to this, we discovered the antibiotics and how to fix bacteria infections. During this period they killed a lot of people and they developp around the country. Now, we cure people who have an infection. The problem of the 21th century is the bacteria resistance. We need to developpe new antibiotics.', \"The last summer, I was in stage for my studies during six weeks. With the pharmacist, i could learn a lot of things.

Two weeks after start my stage, the pharmacist propose me to visit CERP which is a big enterprise in the pharmacy.

Actually, this discovery was made by accident. Sir Alex Dupont was cultivating bacteria for research, and some fungi contaminates the culture. It was Sir Alex Dupont assistant who left the culture boxes open when they went onto vacations, which let the fungus grow with bacteria.\\nThe fungus, named Penicillium sp,  produced a molecule which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of some kinds of bacteria. The scientist had the ideas to use this molecule to treat human infectious diseases during World War II.\\n Now, I am going to talk about the consequences of this discovery.\\nThe penicillin was then used as an antibiotic (because it was the first of this group of drug) to treat human various infectious diseases during World War II, and even today. This drug was used a little bit too much in my opinion. It was seen as the miracle drug, and used far all kind of diseases, even when it was not caused by bacteria.\\nIt happened that nowadays, we have to create new and more powerful antibiotics to cure these infectious diseases, because new resistant bacteria emerges as a result of massive and unappropriate use of the old antibiotics. These resistant bacteria are known as \"super bugs\", and are very difficult to cure with antibiotics we can have in pharmacies, such as amoxicillin.\\nTo conclude, we have now to pay attention to use the right antibiotic to treat the right bacteria, to avoid the emergence of new and stronger super bugs.', \"The story of vaccination.\\nDuring the XIXthe century, particularly during the epidemia of pox, a scientific called Alex Dupont find a way to protect the population from this disease.\\nIn fact, after seeing farmers with infected cow he understand that they doesn't develop the pox infection.

It wasn't a ethical way to test his theory.\\nAfter a few days, he saw that the child doesn't develop the infection, so he deduced that to administer a less dangerous form of a virus protect from more dangerous form.\\n Thanks to this discover we can protect the population from a lot of diseases, and a lot a mortal disease are eradicate. So it's a good thing.The only way to eradicate virus is that vaccination cover all the population and all around the world.\\nToday, some peoples critics the impacts of vaccines and refused to vaccines their child. For them there is too much risk to develop disease due to the vaccination.\\nIt permit to some virus to come back like measles, so we had to make prevention and to remind the importance of vaccination.\", 'Genetic is one of the bigger progress of the century.

When a young couple with a baby have a case of mental illness in their family a test is possible. This test will be able to tell you if you the baby will have this mental illness. Then they can make their choice to keep or not the baby.\\n I think genetic is a gift for the scientific wold and we should use it. It can allowed to save people and to make us stronger.\\nThe genetic have to be use with intelligence and it have to ne controled. Otherwise it can leads to problems like eugenism.', \"I am going to describe the luckiest experiment of all the time. It was a medicine experiment that has helped million of people all over the world.\\nIn 1928, Sir Alex Dupont and his assistant worked on bacteria and mushrooms. Each one were on their own work without paying attention about the other. They decided to take some rest but they forgot their work and let the culture proliferate.\\nSo they traveled during 2 weeks, when they came back bacteria, mushrooms were developed on the culture. That mushroom was Penicilium sp. Alex Dupont has instantly understood the power of this discovery. Antibiotics was born this day.\\n I will explain first what the story shown and after i will describe my point of view\\nThe penicillin was overused in the 2nd world war for bacteria  because it was the first antibiotic but people didn't imagine the consequences. Resistance occurred and now a lot of super bug are here and they are really hard to fight.\\nAntibiotics saved a lot of life in the past few years but now super bug were born and the goal is to create better antibiotics that don't cause resistance or the number of people infected will increase and we will have to fight against something we can't kill\", \"2018 could be the most important year in science history. Few months ago a resercher has discovered a new molecule that will change our lives. This resercher and his work team created by synthesis a molecule with very interesting properties. They already test it on animals and during these tests they saw that animals wich received this molecule could live 2 or 3 times more longer than the other animals which received a placebo.\\nIn fact this is the biggest science discovery since the penicillin in 1928. The product did not show any nefast effects. Furthermore clinical tests on human being will start in few days. Of course a human can live much more longer that a rat but scientist said that they could see if there is a delay in cellular death also in a couple of month they will be able to say if this new medication is really efficient and without any danger.\\n In my opinion, play with human lives is very dangerous. First there will be inequalities between the poor and the rich. A medication that can increase by 2 your life will obviously cost a lot.\\nIn one hand a magical pill like that it's amazing, who didn't thought one day about to be immortal ? But on the other hand it's a lot of problems. If everybody can live so longer there will be billions and billions of human in Earth, we will not be able to feed all these people for exemple. Also a lot of ethicals problems will appear.\\nWe need to be very carefull with new technologies and new discoveries.\", 'I would like to share with you something I think it is very important concerning the development of human health. It is one of the biggest and greatest inventions of the medical world, something which change many people life. It is actually the HIV treatment.\\nBefore this treatment, especially in Africa, people though that when you was HIV positive, this constituted the end of your life. There were a lot of misconceptions about that disease : the way to be contaminated, the number of years that a person who are HIV positive could live...\\nPeople with the virus did not have the support of their family, even not the support of the community. Life projet like marriage, find a good job, have a family or something very simple like live with others were not possible if the disease was there.\\nMany people had been killed not by the disease, but because of the lonelyness. One of the misconception were that, if you have skin contact with someone who live with the virus, you can get it.\\nNowadays, thanks to the HIV treatment, things become to change. For example, we can see women or men with the disease make a family and get married,,and above all of that, they can have children and live normaly, the same way people without the virus do. This treatment are a real revolution. But many efforts have to be made again, espacially in countries which do not have a high level of life.\\n This is a real progress.', \"When I was fifteen years old, I  realised a stage into a clinical pharmacy. This stage was a very good experience for me. It helps me a lot about what type of job I want to practise in the futur. The first day, I went to the cardiologic department , when I was allowed to watch a chirurgical operation. This intervention consisted to remove a little metastasic tumor. The main pharmacist needs to assist the team of surgeon. Indeed,  the pharmacist takes a decision about the  dosage of adrenergic  injection necessary in order to  maintain pantient's vitals fonctions without developing some risks of toxicity.Moreover, I went to the sterilization department and ....\\n It was a very good experience for me. Thank's to this stage and the pharmacist's team to take time to explain me their job. It increase a lot my medical knowledge and give me new skills. That's why I want to become a clinical pharmacist actually.\", 'I will try to decribe you how MRI works.\\nIn first place you need a magnet, a very stong magnet. He must be at 3.5 or 4 Tesla (Tesla is the unit of magnetic field). Well 3.5 or 4T you surely think that he is not really strong but believe me he really is !\\nThis magnet must be cooled by liquid nitrogen and that is the large cercle where we go through when we do an MRI.\\nThe goal of this big magnet is to set all the hydrogen spin on the same direction. (You can imagine the spin as a ball turning on itself, rotations can be clockwise or not clockwise. If it is clockwise, the spin is up and not it is down.)\\nThe next step is to disorganise spins. To do that we use electromagnetic flashs whitch are at the resonating frequency of hydrogen. To visualise that, you can imagine the direction of the spin pointing up, and now they are pointing right because of the flash.\\nNow with detectors we can calculate the among of time the spin needs to point to up again.\\nWith other magnets (weaker than the first), we can applie a gradient to the subject.\\nSo with all of that we can make a matrix, with the hydrogen density and then convert it in a picture.\\nIt is a really quick presentation of the MRI works because it is way more complicated. I hope that was understandable.\\n This discovery was very important for medecine.\\nIt is a non-invasive screening technic and we can use it even on pregnant women.', 'Last year, I went to study pharmacy in Paris, in Paris spacially. I participed at all pharmacy\\'s clases in spanish like a Spanish students. But I do Spanish clases too because I didn\\'t pratice Alex Dupont until two years.\\nIn Paris, the organisation is very different. They had clases on the morning until 3:00 PM maximum and somethimes, a week with practical on the afternoon. Furthermore, they eat a sandwich at 11:00 more or less, a \"bocadillo\" like they sayed but I\\'m no adapted at this kind of pratic.\\nParis is a little city, a old beautiful city, classified at UNESCO. A lot off ERASMUS students went here. That\\'s why I meet a lot of people of different country. I lived in a shared plate with two other Spanish girls.\\nI could visit too, and go to other city like Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris and Paris...\\n This experience has wonderful. It permit to improved my spanish first, to meet people from all of the word, and to learn an other culture. It\\'s an openminded experience.', \"One of the most famous discovery in the domain of the parmacy, was the penicilline. A molecule that is produce by some fungii.\\nAlex Dupont was a microbiologist who worked on Staphylococcus Aureus, a bacteria involve into some human pathology. He forgot one of his experience in his lab and an other scientist, who work on fungii (Penicillium notatum), contaminate some of Alex Dupont's culture.\\nWhen Alex Dupont come back to his lab, he discover that, where the Penicillium notatum were develop, there is no bacteria. This effect is due to penicilline, a molecule produce by the fungus.\\nThe discovery of the penicilline was the first beta-lactam, a antibiotic class, and became one of the most important step in the fight against bacterial illness.\\n In medicine, there is two great revolution. The first was clean water and the second was antibiotics.\\nMore and more epidemic bacteria are resistant. That's why it's very important to develop new antibiotics drugs to fight against the development of resistance.\", \"I'm gonna write on one of the most famous discovering in the 19e century. It wasn't expected but the conclusion of the experience were still use nowadays.\\nIt was on a cloudy and rainy morning on the 25th september 1928, the Alex Dupont's scientific assistant was discovering an unusual response of the bacteria he had put in culture before. The principal goal of the experience was to analyze the antibacterial effect of the lysozyme of the bacteria.\\nHowever, the culture were contaminated by a mushroom specie called Penicillium notatum ( well known with the term Clamoxyl ) . A big inhibition circle were appeared and could be seen in the Petri boxes.\\nAfter analyzing and putting in culture the Penicillium notatum, the Alex Dupont's assistant discovered a way to inhibit the bacteria proliferation and revolutionized the diagnosis and the treatment in term of bacteria's infection  . All the congratulations went to Alex Dupont, and the history has remembered him for the discovering even if the job was done by his scientific student.\\n First of all, my opinion is clearly positive and for a pharmacy student, it talks! I think I'm open-minded and have facilities to accept contradictions and debate but I can't imagine people having a negative and closed position to this discover.\\nOn the one hand, it has permitted to change people's lives and save many lives. Thanks to the experience, the Penicilines are still efficient for many diseases and takes the lead of the ATB in the world (the most common ATB). So useful, so precious and involve the way to treat diseases and cure people.\\nOn the other hand, we've seen for many years the afthermaths of the massive use (constantly...maintly...): we can talk about resistance, the inefficiency, the weakness of this atb class for others diseases........\", \"The discovery of penicillin\\nPenicillin is one of the first antibiotics found. In 1928, Dr Alex Dupont forgot his Petri culture for two weks. After that delay, he observed a contamination by fungi from another Petri culture, which has been incubated at the same time. The fungi contamination has inhibated the developpement of bacterias. The fungi have produced a toxin, the penicillin, headed to the bacterias and their growth.\\nThe developpement of the product of the fungi Penicillium has lead to the production of it as a cure to some bacterial infection. The developpement was accelerated by the Second world war and the emergency of finding medications to treat soldier's infections. Within 4 years, the penicillin was synthetized and industrially produced in high quantities.\\nFor the following decades, the use of penicillin became a habit to every hospital and genral practitioners to provide strong bacterial infection such as pulmonar infection, septicemia etc. Following this discover, the scientists succeded to develop other families of antibiotics and optomized their production and therapeutical use.\\n The consequences :\\nThe discovery of penicillin is the first antibiotic to be found and developped extremely quickly. The production's capacities weren't as efficienty as it is now. It saved thousands of lifes, at the front during the WWII and after that, to treat epidemias, which devasted countries by that time. It saved thousands of lives and prevent injuries such as necrosis and general septicemia.\\nThe production of the penicillin is also cheap, so the cost is supportable even for in-developpement countries. The speckter of action is also large, with a three times-a-day administration. It is taken oraly, so it doesn't required a medical structure. It is really useful on the field, in region where the access to the health care system is not optimal. The statistics showed a significative link between the developpement and the use of penicillin and the inscreased of life rate in the world.\\nWith a worldwide and frequent use come side effects. One of the main consequences is the developpement of resistance from the bacteries. The antibiotic selects the resistant mutans and destroyed the rest of the population, which is provided the developpement of resistance. It slows down the efficient treatement of the specific bacteria and held to  difficulties of treating properly the patient.\\nAs a conclusion to this discovery, it helps dealing with lethal diseases which were stricking a century ago, but the developpement of resistances from the bacteries led to apply protocoles to have a better use of antibiotics and adaptation to the resistance's mechanism.\", 'I will talk about the vaccination. The vaccination had been discover in the years 1700. It allow the chance of not got the diseases. A day, a scientific introduce a cow\\'s virus \"variole\" at children and adults for see the consequences. Indeed, the children are contamined at the disease, but after cure and better healthy, the children will not contamine other one at the virus.\\n I think that the vaccination is better discover of the world. The vaccination had allowed to save people, before be sick. It had changed the life of people.', 'I explain the vaccination in Paris.\\nMany studies show the decline of vaccination from many years. It is explained by religion, personal history. Beside, the journalists create polemics about aluminium in vaccin.\\nSo, the government create a schedule to vaccinate people. There are eleven vaccins who are obligatory since 2018. The priority is to vaccinate child.\\nThe lack of vaccination improves diseases like measles, poliomyelitis, tetanos.\\n In my opinion, it is important to vaccinate our family. Because, this vaccination avoids major disease and avoid to contamined person with immunosuppression.\\nMoreover, the vaccination permit to eliminate these diseases in the country.\\nBeside, there are not any studies who show link between aluminium and multiple sclerosis.', \"In the past, people used to get diseases with a high death-rate because of the lack of treatment. In the late 18th century however, thanks to the discovery of vaccination, these diseases got less important.\\nVaccination has been discovered by Alex Dupont during an epidemy, causing pustules all over the body first, and then complications such as difficulty to breathe and high fever. However, he saw that children working with cows were not as much affected by the disease, they only got one little pustule. Therefore, he took what was inside this unique pustule, and injected it in a baby's arm. This baby never got the deathly disease either.\\nThe method to create vaccines is almost the same nowadays. We use either living or dead viruses, depending on the disease.\\n Vaccination has allowed people to live longer, and to avoid suffering from the horrible consequences of some diseases. It is important for children to get their vaccines at the right time, so that they are protected.\\nIt is a great discovery, however some people are trying to convince everyone not to get vaccinated. It is their risk to take, but I would rather not die from a disease that has no cure if I get a vaccine.\", \"I'm going to talk about a pharmacy's experience : one of the bigget discoveries in the pharmaceutical field is probably the discovery of Alex Dupont in 1928.\\nIn fact, Alex Dupont uncovered accidentally the penicilline G in his laboratory, returning from his holidays, he observed a mushroom that killed the project he had left before leaving.\\nToday, the penicilline is used a lot, is a antibiotic created from some kind of mushroom 'Penicillium', it's for  the treatment of bacterial infection.\\n To my mind, this discovery changed the whole story concerning antibacterial agents and antibiotics, it allowed to save many of  lifes in history and during WWII.\", 'I will talk about the antibiotics. They were discoved by Alex Dupont in 1928. It was a huge coincidence when he returned to his laboratory his cultures of bacteria have been contaminated. At this moment Alex Dupont discover the penicilline and so the beginning of antibiotics.\\nThe antiotics are very efficient for infections by bacteria, viruses,..\\n the antibiotics are very useful but they are not automatic. In fact in the case of the angina, she can be cause by a virus so the antibiotics are not functional. More over bacteria developped more and more resistance against antibiotics.\\nSo this methode of traitment are useful for littles infections', \"Today I'm going to talk about a laser surgery to correct myopia.\\nFor many years, glasses and contact lenses were the only options if you had myopia. But now you can have a laser surgery and you won't be myopic anymore. You have to be at least eighteen, and your vision must be stable since at least two years. The operation is 15-minutes long for each eye, and only needs a local anaesthesia. With the help of a laser, the surgeon will cut a part of the cornea and then modify the curvature of the eyeball to improve your vision. After the operation, the vision can be a little blurry, that's why it is important to rest and follow the post-operation care closely. After only a few weeks, people who underwent the operation claims that their vision has clearly improved and that they don't need glasses anymore.\\n I think that this laser surgery can improve people's lives.\\nGlasses are fine, but they can be a little bit bothering if it's rainy outside for example, and it is worth saying that some people don't like the aesthetic of glasses. Contact lenses can be a good alternative, but at the end of the day, the eyes can be really dry because of them. Moreover, some people will never be able to wear contact lenses in their life. That's why the laser surgery is important, because it gives people an other opportunity to correct their myopia, and this surgery improves your vision for life. It is not only a correction of an optic problem, it is a long-term solution. In addition to that, the surgery is short and mostly well-tolerated.\", \"vaccination principle is to  innoculate to someone viruses or bacteria in order to protect this person against these germs.\\nIt has been discovered in Paris during the 19th century by a doctor which had pointed out that farmer's children didn't catch chickenpox. He understood that these children had caught a less aggressive form of the virus which normally infect cattle and had developped antibodies against it. Then, when they were in contact with the real chickenpox virus, their antibodies were already prepared and the virus couldn't infect them.\\nFrom this observation, he begun to innoculate all children with this cow's virus and it worked : they didn't catch chickenpox\\nToday, vaccination is much less archaic. We use deactivated virus and bacteria, or even just their envelop, to ensure that we are not ill after the injection. There are additives in some vaccines to stimulate immunitary system to create antibodies. Sometimes, multiple injections are needed to make sure antibodies have been made\\n Thanks to vaccination, millions and millions of lifes has been saved. However, even today, there are still lots of people who don't want to vaccinate their children. In their opinion, it is not safe to inject germs and other product in their baby's veins, which, at first, is comprehensible. But, in fact, it is much more safer than catching an uncurable disease. Moreover, some kids can't be vaccinated because their immunitary system isn't well working or for other reasons, so we must vaccinate every other person so that immunitary deficient children won't get disease from non-vaccinated people.\\nThere is a lot of rumor about vaccination like some could cause autisma for example. This false rumor has been spread by a pharmaceutical industrial who wanted to sell his own products by bashing other labs\\nTo conclude, vaccination has been a big step in the medical field. It save millions of people everyday and we will continue to develop new vaccines against new germs. However, to make it work, we must vaccinate the most people we can, so that immunitary deficient patient won't catch these diseases, and we will maybe make these germs disappear forever\", 'The microscope was invented back in the sixteenth century. While it was designed to be used to count threads in fabric, it has become a very important technology used widely in science. Its discovery has allowed mankind to see what had never been seen before : things so small the human eye was not able to distinguish.\\nDiscovering the structure of the cell was vital to understand most disease, that had nothing but empirical treatments before : by learning the changes the cells undergo during the disease, scientists were able to design drugs that have a specific action.\\nMoreover, the cause of most diseases were unknown before the discovery of bacteria, which happened thanks to the microscope. Doctors were then able to know what caused the disease, and even more importantly, to know how they spread. This crucial information helped to protect wide population groups of even getting sick, by spotting efficiently the source of outbreaks. For example, the bacteria causing cholera can be found in wells infected by human secretions. Protecting the water and getting rid of human fluids properly helped the outbreaks to stop, at least in developed countries.\\nToday, the microscope is also used as a mean of diagnosis : when people are infected, or have a serious disease of unknown cause, it is very easy to take a sample of body fluids, and use the microscope to look for any disturbance in the usual signs. Some fluorescent antibodies have even been developed : it helps spotting abnormalities in blood samples and biopsies.\\nEven now, the microscope industry is always trying to see tinier things : not so long ago, researchers were able to see a single atom thanks to an incredibly precise microscope. These microscopes are fundamental when it comes to research, and their use seems to be limitless.\\n The microscope is an amazing discovery, and I believe that while there are a lot of other ways to diagnose diseases, it is still crucial. Most infections (caused by bacteria, viruses or even parasites) use microscopical proof as their main mean of diagnosis, even nowadays. While biochemical tests are expending their ability, evidence from microscopical observation is still a very trusted method of diagnosis.\\n Microscopes are also very useful in research. It is very hard for the human brain to understand and trust theories without seeing the result of theses theories, and the microscope has exactly this function. Some concepts are very hard to comprehend without a visual depiction, especially for visual learners. Hence, the microscope helps the researchers to get a practical idea of the thing they are studying.\\nMoreover, it is a very inexpensive mean to diagnose a lot of diseases, which has a very obvious benefit when it comes to socially shared health expenses. Reducing the cost of diagnosis is definitely needed in a time of economical crisis such as ours.\\nTo conclude, I believe that the microscope is vital when it comes to both diagnosis and research in an economically efficient way, and it will most likely be used for a long time in the future.', 'I consider that taking care of someone is an important part of my activity as a student in pharmacy. To me, many people forget about this part of their job or don\\'t give this the importance that it should.

A lot of lives can be saved with this treatment. It\\'a about an act of prevention. The vaccination was discoved in the 17 century. This practise consist to inject the virus in the goal to create a liitle inflammatory reaction. At the second meeting, the organism recognizes the virus. The inflammatory raction can be attack the virus and kill him. We are talking about immunization.\\n Many people are against the vaccination. They think injecting the virus can be dangerous. I not agree, indeed I think that it prepares the body to fight it.\\nMore, we only get vaccinated to protect ourself and others because we live un community.\\nThe vaccination allowed to eradicate some pathologies.', 'The conquest of the Space\\nBack in the early sixties the cold war between the western and the eastern world had begun for years but it really started when the first man was sent to space.

The surgeon had his hands on two joystics and controlled 4 articulated arms which were in the patient's body in 4 different little holes. He has his head on a screen with sort of glasses like microscope or binocular microcope. The camera was really good, there was a strong light and we saw everything on a screen.\\nThe 4 arms can have different accessories and the surgeon controlled only 3 out of 4 ; 4 is when there is two surgeons working together.\\nThe second seat where the second surgeon usually seat was free so we went on it just to see as if we where surgeons.\\n It was amazing. I was amazed ; when I went to the room I was sort of shocked : the 5 first minutes, I didn't realise that the robot was in the body and that we saw the body's interior ; it was sort of unrealistic and futurist.\\nThen we discussed with the surgeon and he said that all the positive points due to this robot were incredible :\\nLess invasive surgeries : only 4 little holes and not a big one\\nPossibility to look and zoom in the body\\n (he said that some surgeons saw anatomic structures that they had never seen before !)\\nMore and more precision (all the moves are very little, with the help of the robot).\\nOne last point that shocked me was the ability and how easily the surgeon did that surgery : maybe it is his work but he was doing a prostatectomy andjust talked about his friend's food habits with other people in the room as if he was in a bar !\\nTo conclude, that was amazing and I really loved that morning.\", \"In the 20th Century, Alex Dupont discovered penicillin. It was a discovery based on a unexpected situation. Alex Dupont was realizing some experiences on a petri box, but these experiences didn't work so he threw up the box in a been. Few days after, he saw this box in the been and his eyes was attracted by something. A mushroom was grown in the box. Moreover, he noticed that there were no bacteria around this mushroom anymore. He concluded that the mushroom had killed bacterias. So he discovered penicillin, the main ingredient of antibiotics.\\n Since this discovery we develop a lot of antibiotics, many vaccines and other medications. We are able to cure many more infections. The death range causes by infections has decrease in the last century. Now people survive when they have an infection due to a bacteria, because before, it had mostly mortal consequences. But nowadays, there are more and more bacterias who develop resistance against the antibiotics. Certainly because of their bad utilization.\\nIn my opinion this discovery had played an essential role in the development of the medicine. It was the beginning of many other revelations.  And it’s the reason why we can live longer than before. But we have to use it very carefully. « Antibiotics are not automatics ». We must use it only when is necessary to avoid this problem of bacterias’ resistance.\", 'At the end of my first year of medicine, I spent a month in a psychiatric hospital, the first week as an auxiliary nurse and the 3 next weeks as a nurse, but mostly observing in both cases.\\nI saw different kinds of patients and pathologies : alcoolics, depressive people and some with more serious deseases as schizophrenia.\\nI helped with the meal preparation, and the daily life of the patients : helping them to wash themselves, to walk etc\\nI also participated in the the cleaning of the rooms, the bathrooms and changing the sheats of the beds for example.\\nIn addition, I helped with more medical oriented tasks as taking blood pressures, blood samples, giving medications in the form of pills or injections (in the shoulders or the butt).\\nBut most of the time, patients didn\\'t need a technical medical car but only needed to talk to someone.\\n I really enjoyed this time spent in the hospital.\\nIt was my first experience with patients and I appreciated a lot the relationnal aspect of medicine and health care that I couldn\\'t see during my first year when I was working for the contest.\\nIt was also a great discovery to understand that people in psychiatric hospitals are not \"mad\" people as we often think, but are just sick people that need as much care and attention (if it isn\\'t more) as the usual patients with only physical injuries or diseases.\\nBut I also felt powerless when I saw that because the disease couldn\\'t be \"seen\" or \"touched\" it was so difficult to treat it, and that several patients, and some of them very young, were spending several years in those hospitals before doctors could find the appropriate medications that would allow the patients to live a normal life again.', \"Over the past few years, cellphones have taken more and more space in our lives. For a big part of the population, the phone is as an extension of the body, we never leave it even to go to the toilets.\\nThat's why developers got the idea to create applications to follow our health.\\nThus, a diabetic person can check his glycemia by writing the results of his glycemia tests in his phone, and if the app says the results are bad, he can alert a doctor or emergency. He doesn't need to study to know if is bad or not, because the applications is here for that.  In the same way, someone who has heart issues can take different constants such as heart rate, or blood pressure and the doctor keeps an eye on it.\\nIn a more common way, you can now have applications to be sure you are moving enough during the day, for example an application that counts the number of steps you take during the day.\\n On one hand, I think these applications are a good innovation because they give more autonomy to people. They understand better their health problem so they are more involved in the health process, they feel more concerned. Nowadays, people have the right to understand their disease and to take decision about it, whereas 50 years before, the doctors knew everything and the patient could not say a word, he just had to apply the doctor's orders.\\nMoreover, it is a good way to watch over the patient, it is more safe. Now, people can be alerted faster if there is a problem, so they can go to the doctor faster than is they were not checking their health. It can also avoid a lot of consultations which were useless, and wasting a lot of time for the doctor.\\nBesides, it can also encourage people to take care of themselves. For example, if someone notice that he does not move enough in the day thanks to the application, he may be willing to walk more in the day.\\nOn the other hand, some people refuse to enter some personal data in their mobile, because it scares them that the data will be sent and used by people they don't want to. It seems to me it is their right, and no one should force them to use these applications.\\nNevertheless the doctor should inform them of the benefits and the risks, thus the patient can take his decision on his own and well informed.\", \"At the end of the PACES, the first year of medicine, we must do a practice in the hospital during four weeks.\\nThe first 2 weeks I was in the cardiology service. This was the first time I work in a hospital.\\nI spent time with nurses and auxiliary nurse. I looked how they work and I tried to do the same like take pressure, give medication and do blood test. In this service, patient were independent, so we didn't have to wash their.\\nThe second 2 weeks, I was in the vascular surgery service. I was in contact with people who had an important diabete. contrary to the other service, the patients are very dependent of the medical team.\\n It permits to discover how all the health professional work together. I can saw that there is a real team work and how the communication between doctor and nurses is important to the good supervision of patients.\\nThen, I know more about cardiology diseases and what treatments are use. I really enjoy this 2 weeks in cardiology, I can learned a lot of things.\\nBut the other weeks were more difficult because a lot of patient must be amputate.\\nI discovered how to speak and reassure patients in difficulties. I think it is a good experience for the futur doctor.\", \"Today I will speak about the vaccine. It was discovered in 1885 to heal the illness that make you silly if your blood is exposed to a sick animal. The name of the discoverer is Paster.\\nAll vaccines have in common the way it work. We take an antigene of the illness. We deactivated it. Then we attached it on a thing that help vaccine to be recognized by the immune system of the body. The antigene will provoque the same immune reaction than the original one which is producing a lot of special cells. These special cells will be specific to fight against the antigene. They have two ways to destroy it. Either they can kill it directly or they can produce antibody against it.\\nTo finish, the goal of vaccines is to simulate a first immune reaction against the illness to have a stronger answer if after the illness affects a person.\\n In my opinion, vaccines are very useful. Many people says that it dangerous to take it because of the possible allergies. But the probability to have an allergie is lower than having the illness. Furthermore, there are vaccines to fight against terrible and horrible illness.\\nTo finish, many persons say the fact some vaccines are mandatory is a choice to make pharmaceutical industries more wealthy than they are now (which is difficult I think). But I don't think so because they don't earn a lot on it.\", 'I\\'m gonna talk about one of my experience as medical worker.\\nAt the end of my second year of medicine, I worked for the first time in an EPHAD  (sort of center for elder person) as an auxiliary. I discovered the envirnment where medical staff (like nurse)  used to work.\\nI saw how careful and kind could the medical staff be; as much as they could be rash, brutal and disrepectful with some residents. I don\\'t judge them for their behaviour because sometimes people living over there were not easy to manage. Most of the people working at this EPAHD were \"human\", they were really concerned by the mental end physical health of the residents.\\nIt is very stressful to work right there because we have to work efficiently and to be fast at the same time. We have a dozens tasks to do, and it changes every day (even in the same morning or afternoon sometimes).  Indeed, we have to take care of all the 60 residents at the same time and to do what is asked by the direction. I know it\\'s hard to be always smiling and kind when we are under pressure. However, it doesn\\'t justify all the bad actions some employee made.\\n So, after my one month working in an EPHAD and my experience at hospital, I really understood how hard it was to be a nurse, an auxiliary and a helping-nurse (AS in french ?).\\nThere are not enough staff, whether for nurses, auxiliary or helping-nurse. They can\\'t be asked to do millions things correctly, to be kind with everybody, to take time to take care of all patients and to do all of this quickly. It\\'s simply IMPOSSIBLE.\\nSome doctors are forgetting that when they ask \"little things\" to nurse, it\\'s already too much for them.\\nI think that I will never forget how important it is to be careful and respectful with our collegues. If medical staff is not well treated (intern students as well), how can we expect them to be good/to treat correctly their patients ?\\nTo be able to take care/to treat in best conditions our patients, we have to be treated with kindness and respect as well.', 'I will speak about the anathomopathology, also called anapath.\\nIt a medical speciality where scientist have to describe macroscopic and microscopic lesions and how cells interact together.\\nAnapath is used in diagnosis to reveal diseases, but also to evalue the pronostic of a tumor or in DNA therapy.\\nAnathomopathologist work also in research, for example in epidemiology, to make statistic or to develop new therapy more resistant.\\nThis speciality work on cell or tissue prelevment made on body. Doctors have to fixed them in formol, to keep the organisation, then to include in parrafin, to cut thanks to a microtome in a microscopic band, to observe it under a microscope.\\n On one hand, this speciality is very important in medecine, because it helps the clinician to cut of tumor. In fact it will indicate to the surgeon if he \"kills\" all the tumor. It\\'s now better because we don\\'t have to make the operation, then verify with a scann or MRI if the surgeon worked well, and if it\\'s not a good work, call again the patient to operate another time.\\n  On the other hand, anapath can also reserch specific proteins to see if a treatment will work on a patient. In other words anapath brings a pronostic. Now a patient can recieve a treatment if we know that it will work on him.', 'Since last year, I am following a master degree in cancerology. I was absolutely amazed by learning how new technologies could change the way to cure patients, the way to treat many diseases with a lot of innovations.\\nOne of them that makes me suspicious are the GMOs. There are plants, or parts of plants, which are modified by humans to earn special characteristics for example not to died because of pesticides, to resist to insects of predators, not to suffer from the hot or the sun, etc. It also could be modified animals ou any alive modified system. But we have working on plants exclusively. I can give examples of using :\\n- In developing countries, mostly poor countries like in Africa for instance, there are special rizes that are made to become more nutritional for peoples, and to prevent for diseases like diarrhea.\\n- There is a kind of OGMs invented to resists to pesticides not to died when farmers use it to destroy unwanted plants.\\nGMOs are really controlled by European (EFSA) and French (ANSES) control agencies of respect of environnement. In fact, in Paris, OGMs are not authorised to be sold, because the government and scientists criticize the impact on health and environment. They explain they don\\'t have enough hindsight, that there are not affirmations like \"OGMs are safe\" or \"OGMs are dangerous\". Thinkings and opinions seem to be quite differents and perhaps influenced by lobbying and laboratories that want OGMs to be commercialized.\\nAs far as I am concerned, I think I have to show my two points of view.\\nFirst, as a scientific student, I\\'m asking myself about diseases and the influence of OGMs on cancers and degenerative diseases. Maybe OGMs could modified our own genes, our own bacteries? Perhaps I could become allergic? And what about the environment? Studies seem to show that the special culture of thoses plants could affect the ground for many years.\\nThen, as a common person, by the way, I am a little bit scared by introducing new kind of food in my alimentation routine. Furthermore, one of the key purpose of this innovation is the price. As a student, I sometimes have to make both ends meats simply to be able to eat everyday, so I don\\'t think the cost would be accessible for me. Moreover, what about the taste ? What could proove me that I will love modified-tomatoes as much as classical-tomatoes.\\nThere are many questions I am asking myself. I am not for, I am not cons. I really want to learn more to have a concrete opinion on it.', 'I want to talk about the discovering of the Down syndrome or trisomy 21. This type of genetic issue touches 1.45 peoples over 2000, and it is  known from centuries. But the scientific answer was in 1953. A french doctor, named Alex Dupont, discovered that it was due to a caryotype with 47 chromosome with 3 chromosome 21.\\n  If we talk about the different criteria of this injury , we can remark that there is some evidence on the phenotype of the new born that show us the trisomy 21. In it’s general aspect the new born has a hypotonia.First we can see that the eyes of the new born have a specific inclination ant an epicanthus. If we look at his hand, there is an brachymesophalangis on the fifth finger, and there is a split in the and that it’s pathognomonic.\\n It was a very great discover for the world.', \"During the 3rd year of medicine studies, we realized some training at the hospital in order to increase our abilities to communicate with the different kind of patient. The fact that the practitioner explain him how I can correctly make an intervention permits me to be greater in the communication field. I hope I'll be able to use this advice and transmit them to the next generation of GP.\\nHowever, at the beginning of my study, I thought that the incursion in the professional domain will be later. That's why I was surprised of this news and a little bit worried.\\nIn few years, I would like to be one of the best digestive surgeon because I like put my hands in the viscera to relieve them. I think the fact to literally 'repare' the human body is one the biggest satisfaction that people can have in his life. Indeed, that's not something which is abstract, the whole population can understand this idea.\\nI have had the chance to assist at some surgery like a 'sleeve', and I have directly known that's what I would like to do later. This surgery implies to be precise in a one hand and focus on your work in another hand. To make this dream of surgery possible, I watch some videos about this domain in order to understand the different protocole.\\nAs for me, I knew that the surgery domain interested me but the training in different ward have confirmed my ambition to begin digestive surgeon. This training must be developed to permit for some people to find their vocation.\\nFurthermore, the cooperation of the practitioner must be more important because certains physicians didn't know what kind of support should be used to train us.\", \"I'm going to talk here about the NGS : Next Generation Sequencing. It's a kind of new technologie that permits to get the sequence of the entire genoma in a short periode of time, and with fewer costs than earlier technologies.\\nTo obtain the DNA sequence, researchers first need to extract the DNA from a complete random cell of the human body, thanks to strongs fluids that break the cells membrane. After precipitation, they harvest a double complete filament of DNA. The second step is the Denaturation to obtain a simple filament, after that they do what we call PCR is amplificate the sequence, then they put all the fragments they harvested into a solution with dNTPs (nucleotids that don't have an OH at the end of their molecule so that they create a blocage when they are inserted into the complementary DNA sequence) and normal nucleotids.\\nThe new solutions composed of previously harvested DNA, dNTPs and normal nucleotid's bases, should now appariate itself complementary to get a new double filament of DNA.\\nThe new filament obtained is then composed of an ancient part (from the human cell) and a new one which came from the simple nucleotids that appariate together.\\nWhen the dNTP is included into the new sequence, it stops the replication and the filament is complete. Thanks to the previous PCR they obtain those filaments in large quantity, with differents sizes and endings due to the differents lasts dNTPs that have been incorporated during the replication.\\nThose finals dNTPS are combined to a fluorochrome, specific from each kind of nucleotid (A,T,C or G).\\nSo that in the end, we obtain a large amount of sequence with a colored ending that we superpose to each other, to get the entire sequence revealed by the fluorochrome.\\nThis technic permits to reveal mutations in a single one nucleotid base, to diagnost a pathology.\\n This new technic is a relly considerable advance for the genomic field. An anction who used to take years and thousands of dollars, can now be done few hours for 1800$. It is also a lot more precise, because I remind you that we can see mutation for a single nucleotid and visualazing the entire genoma of a person base after base. The diagnosis of gneomic pathologies is a lot more precise.\\nHowever, we need to be careful with the selection of genes to get  perfect individuals and eradicate all defaults that we find in the human being.\", 'After 2 years of first year of medecine \"paces\", I succed my trial. That\\'s why I had to realise a stage at the Hospital in the chirurgical cardiac service for 1 month.\\nIt was a really good experience.\\nSometimes I went at the hospital on the morning, sometimes on the afternoon or also sometimes I had to work during the night.\\nI was with the nurses and they tried to show me and to learn me the different movements which they realize each day on the patient.\\nI learned how to make a blood test, to make a bandage or take it off.\\nPatients who just had subdued an operation on their heart, had a scar which was closed by the doctor thanks to little objects which they permited to close and one day I had to take off these objects.\\nAlso, sometimes their scar had a problem ; for example, a man had complications with his scar, there was an infection. That\\'s why the doctor had to operate him another time and he asked me to be there; I help him a little bit, It was really interesting.\\n .', 'I would like to describe an experience that would certanly takes place in a near futur. This experience consists in doing a \"head greff\". In fact, there is a russian man who suffer from a genetical illness. He is paralized and condamned to be sit in a chair for the rest of his life. He can\\'t speak, eat or doing something by himself. So, when a group of researchers who worked on a relovutionary surgery announced that they were searching patients he purposed him.\\n They had already tested it on monkeys and mise and the surgery succeed. They took a mouse\\'s head in one part and the body of an another mouse in another part and connected the two spine cords between them. It worked on animals but the surgery seems a little bit more complex on the human body because they have to disrupt all the blood and nervous system during a few minutes.\\nI don\\'t know if the surgery had already beeing realise because she is not authorized on the russian soil so she will takes place on a chinese clinic with chinese and italian surgeons. The russian man who accepts to undergo this experimental surgery is now waiting for a compatible body.\\n I think that this experimental surgery has a two-side consequence.\\nFirst, she can be a new alternative for people who suffer from a desease with physical consequences, for people who have all their mind but can\\'t use their body. It can be an escape for them, a way to finally have a fonctionnal body which permits to do whaterver they want to do. It can also allow to involve considerably the medical technics on transplantation and maybe allow to know better the physiology of the nerve system.\\nHowever, this surgery asks ethical questions. Indeed, how recognising himself with a body which is not yours? Are you you again or are you a kind of mix of two people? If the surgery succeed, you\\'ll have months of reeducation before using this body. And if it worked, this sort of experience will certainly open to some disgressions from people with bad intentions.', 'I would like to talk about the sleep. First of all, the sleep is really important because it concerns all of us. Everyone need to sleep but not as long as the other. What I mean is that we don\\'t need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven\\'t sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day. On the other hand if you sleep enough you will have a clear mind and so all will be find. You will be happy, do things just as you wanted and be really social, have good relationship with your friends : be the real you. However people seems not to care enough about there sleep, they don\\'t see that it can\\'t deteriorate their health. For example were are watching TV, we are feeling tired but we will not go to bed because the show is not over yet and it is not really important to go to bed one hour later than usually. If we usually do that, in a long term, we will have debts of sleep. And our body make us understand. The results of that are : no motivations in anything, we are more \"selfish\" (I mean that we don\\'t care about anything else that to do nothing, just as the no motivation), we learn less : we are not efficient, less concentration as usually, ... In other terms, we are a bad version of ourselves.\\nTo continue I would like to introduce the new technology apps which can help us to solve this problem. There is applications or devices which can help us. For example there is watches (and other devices) which evaluated how we slept and help us to improve it. Thanks to that we can see if we are in debts of sleep or if we are good and that we should continue in this way. Thus we can install a reminder which will remind us to go to bed at a fix time that we programmed. It would help us to have a \"routine\" and sleep faster than usually. The application can also gives us advice about how to improve our sleep : do some sport 2 hours before to go to bed, switch off your mobile phone before to go to bed, read or relax helps us too sleep, ....\\nI don\\'t think that the sleep is really important in our society, people don\\'t seems to understand how important it is. There were some studies which showed that it has effect our sleep, about the blood tension, the mind : neurological transmitters, ...\\nSo to conclude I would say that sleep is really important to me (as you may understand), it can helps us to improve ourselves, had a great impact on our health and there are some device which can helps us to correct it.\\n It is not really a discovery but we should put it in the first page and can make it as great discovery. We should be more aware about it. It can helps us and improve our health. Be a better version of ourselves.', 'I would like to talk of the new law about the 11 obligatory vaccinations.\\nLast year, during my seconde year of medicine, I worked on this subject with friends for an exam and I learnt a lot of informations. Before the law applied on the first of january 2018, the number of obligatory vaccinations were 3, others were just recommended. We fount studies about that we call \"vacination cover\" and saw that if a vacination is not obligatory, people think that is not for a \"dangerous\" disease and don\\'t want to receive the vaccin. With the other students we searched about what is happening in the other countries. In Paris for exemple, people trust a lot in their doctor and don\\'t put in reflexion what the doctor say. So, eerybody want to be vaccinaned for all vaccin, even thoses which are not obligatory. In Paris, we know that people are a bit suspicious about their doctor and there is a lack of information about vacination. So the law was the only solution, even if it\\'s complicate in our society to oblige people to do something.\\n For me, it\\'s a good thing, some people are angry about the government because they don\\'t like the \"obligation\" and say that they are free of their bodys, etc. But we need to take this mesure like a good thing for us, it\\'s for our health. I don\\'t have returns of the application of this law because it\\'s too early I think but I\\'m sure that in the few years become, It will be better for everyboy.', \"I would like to share my fascination concerning the laboratory analysis of a simple blood sample. Indeed, thanks to the perpetual progress of biotechnologies, biologists can extract plenty of informations related to our health from this unique blood sample.\\nThis method is really convenient because It's not invasive, patients doesn’t have any scars after the procedure, and it's comfortable for them because it's very quick.\\n Blood sample’s analysis are really helpful for GP because it allows them to diagnose a disease like diabete, to confirm a pregnancy, to follow their patient’s recovery, from a anemia from example.\", \"I'd like to talk about my last year experience at the hospital when I assisted to an open-heart surgery.\\nIt was the first time I went to the theatre room and I discovered all the processus and the technologies used during the operation. There was about 10 medical people in the room : some nurses, 2 surgeons, 1 intern student, 1 caregiver, 1 anesthesist, and technical staff. So much people circled the patient who had been sleeped.\\nThe surgeon opened the rib cage with electric saw, then the pericardium with an other tool. I believe the staff stopped the heart with ice and potassium. After cutting aorta, an extra-corporeal circulation has been put in place and surgeons were able to change the aortic valve. During the process the temperature of the body decreased to 20°.\\n It's really a huge descovery that allows to save lives.\", 'At the end of the PACES, we had a paramedical pratice at the Hospital, with nurses and nursing auxiliaris. It was the first contact with this world, I discovered how a ward is organized, the role of different people who work in. It was weird at the beginning, because I had never seen patients before, some of them were really bad and I felt bad for them, I was like \"How do they support to spend this time in a bed, whithout move or eat even drink?\". Some people were totally dependant of the medical team, I knew that before, but in fact, it\\'s really impressive to see it.\\nWhen I was in the abdominal surgery ward, I saw lots of people with colostomy+, and I think this kind of stuff really difficult to accept it, live with in daily life, mostly when you are young, because it can be an problem for self confidence, find a job, find a person who live with and create a family. I talk about colostomy because I saw it, but I think lots of pathology can cause similary problems.\\n I knew that being hosptilased can be extremly difficult for people  and their family, but I discovered that is over more diffficult when people are alone and nobody come see them, because they don\\'t have good relations with their relatives or because their relatives are too far (for exemple if the patient is a stranger on vacation).  Psychologic side is very important to go with the deases, and to be cure.\\nIt permised me to discover the organisation of a ward, and the fact is that, in the medical team, practionners and nurses doesn\\'t always know each other, certain nurses doesn\\'t know the name of the interns, it\\'s abnormal when you know how long they have working together. On the contrary, nurses and nursing auxiliaries really work in pairs, and that\\'s really good for the good caring of the patient.', \"Most discoveries have been discovered due to a mistake or during hazardous situations. Observation is also a big part in this process and many scientists have discovered incredible things just by looking (and daring to try new method). For example : the vaccination.\\nIt begins with a man who found out that the children who take the milk out of the cows were not contaminated by some diseases. This observation led him to a conclusion : they were protected thanks to their contact with the cows. He decided to inject a disease to the little farmers in order to see the result but they didn't contract the disease. To approve his theory he injected himself a bit of those children’s blood and he exposed himself to the disease but, nothing happened, he was not contaminated.\\nThis was the beginning of vaccines.\\n Nowadays vaccines are the most predictive therapy. They avoid contamination and transmission of some serious infection like some hepatitis or rubella but they have also eliminated some diseases in the world. This the best solution to protect population and avoid epidemics. If you're not vaccinated and surrounded by people who are, you're safe. This is an altruist therapy.\", 'Today, I would like to talk about cancers\\'s research. Indeed, during the last decades there was (is) important studies about the cancer.\\nThe approach I choose is a genetic one : with a much better understanding of the genome, researchers can identifie genes who can lead to cancer or protect us against the cancer.\\nFor that researchers can do several things :\\n- \"Knock down\" of the genes of interest\\n- \"Knock in\" of the genes of interest\\n- track the genes\\n- ...\\nUsually, studies began by a short story of the cancer, and the challenges that came with it. During the first experiment, researchers (usually) show us where the genes (or the protein encodes by the gene) are by using fluorescent markers : this alload us and them to check the position of the gene and his \"time of action\".\\nResearchers can also start and show us the very begining of the experiment : they take a sample of the tumor/tissue of interest, isolate the cells and use flux cytometry to detect all of the genes in the tumor. With a lot of samples it\\'s possible to detect wich genes are always present or absent, wich one are here only in a subtype of tumor...\\nAfter that, researchers can Knock down the genes using a transgenic mice. The transgenic mice is made up by the team : she has modified expression of her genes and she\\'s usually the progenie of two mice who were modified. One of the mice has  gene who is inactive and the other has a marker who is going to attach himself to the kock down gene in the progenie.\\nAter that, researchers can analyzed how the mouse is reacting : they marked their weight, their size, their attract to food,... They can also look how their interact with each others, how their react to fear, to cold water, to the drowning test,...\\nOne thing that matter a lot in oncology is the reaction to drugs : drugs against cancer are very strong and can kill every working or not working mechanism in the body. Scientists are testing the reaction before and after the drug to see how patients would react to the treatment.\\nThanks to the genotyping of the begining, scientists can also compare the reaction of a certain type of tumor and an other type of tumor against the drug : all of the tumor don\\'t express the same genes, wich is tricky because that mean that all of the patient would not be responders. Researchers have to test wether or not a subtype of tumor is responding to the drug because if not the patient is not going to be able to fight against is cancer.\\nWho is responding and who is not responding alload us to gave drugs only to patients who would respond and try other treatments with the non responders.\\n I truly think that research is very important and has to be done because it\\'s the only thing that alload us to create new treatments, help and cure patients.\\nIf we turn our back to research, we chose not to help patient, we deliberetly ignore things that we could know.\\nAbout the cancer research specifically, I think that the more we have data on the non responders and the responders, the more we can chose appropriate drugs to cure/help patients.\\nOn the other hand, we have to be very carrefull about all the data that we collect : indeed, there are a lot of correlation that we don\\'t know about and a lot a things that we don\\'t no for sure of they are significant.\\nFor example, they are some families who have a predisposition to cancer : we can test them and look for the mutation that give the cancer and Watch for the cancer to appear more carefully than the general population. But there are a lot of significant genes discover every weeks so the result is not for sure because theire  are a of mutations that we don\\'t now about, there are also all the mutations who are maybe cancer\\'s help but we don\\'t now about them.\\nResearch in general is a very fascinating subject that alload us (in médicine and in general) to help and create a more comfortable environnment for everyone, that alload us to understand everything that\\'s happening among us.', \"I'm quite proud of what doctors and medicine researchers are able to do to replace a losing part of anyone's body.\\nA few years ago, when somebody lost his arm or his leg, we couldn't replace it and that person ought to learn living without it. It had to be very difficult because losing a part of your body is like losing a part of yourself : it reduced the range of things you can do.\\nNowadays, we can give these people a new body which is entirely working. For example, I heard about a man who lost is hand in a car crash. He was musician but without this hand, he couldn't play the guitar anymore.  Now, he has a new bionic hand et he is learning to use it with playing his instrument.\\nThere are plenty of people in such case and I think it's one a the best progress in science to make people able to do what they want.\\n I think that the capacity of recreating any body parts is a great progress for people but also for the researcher's community. Maybe one day we will be able to recreate an entire and autonomous human organism. I don't say that it will be cool because there will be Artificial Intelligences. I want to say that being able to recreate an entire organism means that we have understood the whole functioning of the human body. Or at least it could help us to understand the few things we have not. And understand the way our body works is one of the first step to cure it when it is touched by miscellaneous pathologies.\", \"So I'm going to talk about the discovery of the small pox vaccine. The small pox at the time was very curent, many people died from it, and the ones who didn't were scared for live. Everyone could be contaminated rich or poor, at any age.\\nAlex Dupont was an english rural doctor in the 18 century. He noticed that girls who milked cow were not contaminated from this disease (most of them) but seemed to have contract an other disease : the cowpox. The cowpox is a virus, present in the bovine, that's why the milker were contaminated. It gives ressemblance symptoms to the small-pox, afterwards the patient have vesicle with pus on his hand or somewhere else.\\nAlex Dupont then thought that the cow-pox was maybe a protection against the small-pox. He tried an experience : he infected an eight years old boy with the vaccine by inoculate pus from a young girl. The boy had a fever, but nothing serious (prouv that he contracted the vaccin). Then the doctor inoculated the variole, and the boy survived, and Alex Dupont discovered a prevention against small-pox. So it's was a huge progress in medicine but at what cost ?\\n I was talking about the discovery of immunisation by Alex Dupont. Nowadays Alex Dupont is considered as the father of immunisation. But what people often forget it's that he wasn't sure of his theory when he tested it on the 8 years old boy. He could have killed him. So we could wonder if he should be described as a hero, or in contrary as a paria. If we should endanger a few people live to save the masses or not ?\\nBecause if we think about it,  in the 50's,  Americans doctor infected prisoners with different disease to observed the evolution of the disease, it was kind of the same thing except, they didn't find anything and they were strongly condemned by the public opinion.\\nThis exemple is for one, one of the basis of immunisation, but also it raise ethical dilemma, witch we still see today. I think the main reason people praise him he that his experience was a success, but I can't forget that he risk a life of someone, who I suppose couldn't understand the risks he was taking.\", 'Last year, during the second semester I was in a class untitled \"genetic of the reproduction\".\\nMy teacher ask me to find a question , in order to do the same work as a seacher in a laboratory.\\nThen I decided to make investigations about the uterine fibroma of african women.\\nIndeed I found lots of articles about studies which  had the same theme.\\nI read more than 50 articles to answer my question.\\nI have noticed that was a mutation which more frequent in african\\'s genes, of course it was just a change of one nucleotid (a valine transformed to a methionine) but doctors found that it could lead to an increase of uterine tumors.\\nThis subject was really important for me because, the uterine leiomyoma are responsable of pregnancy outcomes and infertility. In Paris, in the afro american community there are many histerectomy each year because of this problem.\\nFurthermore, these surgeries are really dramatic for a young woman who want to procreate. On the top of that the operation can be responsable of complications like staphyloccocus infections, uterine artery haemorrhage etc...\\n In my opinion it was a really good experiance for a futur doctor to make the work of a searcher.\\nThe teacher gave us the opportunity to choose or subject so it was more easier to work lots of hours on my project.', \"Few weeks ago, I was at a dentist appointment, and we start talking, mostly him i might say, because she had her tools in my month so responding was quite complicated for me. But as I was suffering, she was telling me about this new research project she was working on with some dentists colleagues, but also doctors, biologists, research scientists and engineers.\\nThe idea of this project is to developp a new technology which would be really helpfull in reparing tissue damage.  This new technology is based on a collaboration between 3D printers developpers and, biologists. Indeed, they are developping 3D printers, that might be able to print a human organ, from a simple blood sample. As of now, they are working more precisely on how to print new human tooth, and how to make it viable in the patient's mouth after implantation. They are starting with tooth because they are quite easily implantable, or removed in case of complications during or after the surgery. But even if printed humain tooth would be a great progress for dentist and their patients, the main goal of this project is to be able to print for example a liver, or a heart for a patient who needs a transplant.\\nThis would substancially decrease the waiting time for patient on the transplant waiting list, because if the project goes as far as it is suppose to, you could be admitted in the ER at 5AM, after a car crash, and from one simple blood sample of yours, 3 hours later, a new heatlhy heart would be created by the 3D printer and ready to replace your own injured heart.\\nThese new printers might also come very handy for those who suffered massive burns, like firefighters, because now, thanks to this engineering/biologists collaraboration, with only few drops of blood in the printer, biologists could print in a matter of hours as much skin tissues as they would need to repair the burned skin.\\nThe main advantage of this new way of creating human organs is the viability of these tissues. Indeed, there would no longer be any matter about donor/receiver compatibility, because the organ would directly come from the receiver, which mean it would be his blood, his genes that would be used to create this new skin, and therefor, no further need to worry about failed transplants.\\nMoreover, organ receivers wouldn't need to wait anymore for other people to die, for them to have organ, they could be treated right away, in better conditions, and in a much more safer and durable way.\\nThis new sciences breakthrought might literaly change the face and pratice of modern medicine, and that is amazing!\\nHowever, no matter how amazing this new project his, they are still working on it, trying to bring it to life, but as of now, they are only able to print human tooth (wich is already quite fascinating), but my entist assured me that in a decade or two, self-printed new skin tissue for burns would be a daily operation.\", 'It had been proved that pain has a subjective aspect.\\nSome doctors of the Queen Mary hospital in Paris have tried to prove that music can have a positive effect on the pain. During medical interventions like kyst ablation for examples, using music can decrease the perception of the pain.\\nDuring their experience, a group of patients had a coloscopy with or without using love and slow songs. After the operation, the patients had to answer to a serie of questions.\\nPatients who had coloscopy with love and slow songs have felt lower anxiety and pain intensity during the intervention.\\nMusic can have a lot of good consequences on other parts of the brain. A college in Paris is using classic music during the lunch to decrease the number of fights and turbulences.\\nUnlike Alex Dupont\\'s film \"Clockwork Orange\", Alex Dupont and classic music can help to reduce violence.\\n Music is already use by doctors and nurses to reduce anxiety and pain during small interventions. A lot of surgeons can\\'t operate without listening to music because they help us to be more focus.\\nI think we can develop it a lot more.', \"The studie was about effects of the music on neurodegenerative illness.\\nIt has been proved that playing music could change cerebral structure and cerebral functions. Music also impact cerebral regions involved in high level cognitives schedules such as attention or memory.\\nPrevious studies had already proved the impact on children brain. Indeed with RMI we found that some musicians cerebral parts  were highly extend in comparaison of a non musician.\\nBut there is a new interest in this studie. Indeed, the music could help to prevent neurodegeneratives pathologies like Alzheimer. This practice won't avoid the apparition of the disease but it could help to retard the symptoms. Music also seems to be very interesting for patient in a critical state of the disease. In fact, most of the time music is the only way for them to communicate. Observations of sing or music classroom has shown an high cognitive wake up for the patients. During these sessions we noticed as well a decreased in their comportemental troubles. To finish, with the help of the music we found that it was possible for Alzheimer patients to learn new things inconsciously with repetitions of tasks.\\n I think this studie shows an alternative way in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It's interesant because it's a low cost possibility to help those people. It is also a way to stimulate them and help them to enjoy therselve. An important point is the fact that there are absolutely no side effects.\", \"I'm going to talk about a research which concern anesthesist.\\nIn the last decades, reseachers works on the effects of the body temperature during and after a surgery.\\nIndeed, they discover that:\\nOn the one hand, if your temperature is to lower, you can have cardiovascular complication for example. You have a worst capacity of recuperation. Your body is more weaker. That's why it's important to regulate it. A patient in hypotermia is difficult to handle, your body release some hormones which have bad effects in this case. A lower temprature demand more energy to struggle against it.\\nMoreover we must be aware that patient are nearly naked, and the surgery room is part of the time cold. That's why we have to be more careful of it.\\nOn the other hand, if your temperature is correct, you have less complications. The patient feels better and recover more easily. He has less impacts of the surgery.\\nTo put in a nutshell, body temperature during surgery has a real impact for the patient ans his recovery.\\n This experience allows at anesthsists to change their practices belong the temperature of their patient.\\nWe can improve his recuperation by simple acts.\\nThis is a new aspect very important for the comfort of our patient, we must keep it in memory.\", \"The engram has been discovered recently in neurology by searchers. It is a concept that tries to modelize a connection between neurones that is created when the brain discovers new things of the world through the eyes, the ears, the proprioception receptors etc.\\nThe theory of the engram applies that when the brain has to encode new informations from the envirronment it creates connections between neuronal cells by putting in place synapses.\\nThese synapses exchange informations and electrical potentials by sending chemical molecules.\\nOnce these molecules have been sent they fix themselves on specifical receptors on the other cell, and that opens a canal into the cell's membrane. These synapses lead neurones to connect and to communicate.\\nThe association of a specifical number of neurones creates a particular signal that is associated to the perception of one thing in the outside by the brain.\\nBy example, if a person sees a black cat for the first time, his eyes see it, send a message to the brain that connect its neurones and creates an engram relative to the black cat.\\nIt has also been proved that these engrams, once identified in the brain, could be controled by laser with a new technic : the optogenetic.\\nThe laser perturbates the engram signal by stimulating or inhibating the electrical activity, and through this perturbation in a mice brain, the comportment  is also modified.\\nFor example, if the exeperimentator decides to stimulate the sexual engram by laser, the mice tested that is isolated with another mice will have sudently a sexual comportment. Meanwhile, if the experimentator stimulates the aggressivity engram then the mice will attack the other one.\\nThis discovery could be very important in medicine to understand some humor comportments in psychiatric domain. Actually, it has been proved that some engrams that were created at the same time by the brain were then associated even if the two elements have nothing in common.\\nFor example, if a patient sees a black cat in the street, he creates a cat-associed engram, but if he is then shot by a car, then the accident engram will be instantly associed to the black cat in its brain : the patient will then be scared of being shot if he sees a black cat again.\\nWe can by the way transfer this idea to violent comportments at the adult time against children.\\nActually, most of sick parents that violently abuse of their children were theirselves abused in their childhood. We can think that their engram of love and family is associed to the engram of violence and so when they have their own baby their engrams active them each others and that creates mental disorders and explains in a way their comportment.\\n This discovery in the neurology domain is a great thing that permits once again to understand better the complicated organ that is the brain.\\nThe understanding of the engrams and the possibility to control them allow new ideas of therapy in case of mental disorder.\\nBut it is important to highlight the fact that this discovery is really new and that controlling the brain is not easy to do and can have many side effects that could be terrible.\\nActually, we have to understand that sometimes human people can not go through anything and that all the diseases are not curable.  The idea of becoming more and more powerfull on our own body can lead to serious problems and all the experiences have to be realized in normal conditions always respecting patients in an ethical way.\\nIf we respect these points, I think that it is amazing to be each day more alert about the brain fonctionment and that it will lead to new therapies that will make some serious diseases less hard, less painfull, and that will make some patient's lifes better.\\nActually, brain diseases are terrible, sometimes coming suddently without any previous symptom and ruin people's life by making them uncapable of walking, talking, sometimes respirating...\\nThey are diseases that scare many people but that can be sometimes cured and we have to encourage that.\", 'Artificial womb\\nResearchers recently found out a new way to conceive babies. Indeed, they constructed an artificial womb which is able to \"replace\" a human womb. A human baby could grow up safely in this machine without needing to be in his mother\\'s belly. It is quite incredible to have been able to build that machine as we know all the specific mechanisms that are required to lead a safe pregnancy. In fact, every foetus needs a specific environment to develop and become a sound baby. It means that the artificial womb has to replace the mother in every single way, such as nutriment supplies which enables the foetus to grow as well as the security and the warmth of the mother\\'s womb. It is quite impressive because this artificial womb is made with a see-trough material so that you could litteraly see your baby\\'s evolutio month after month.\\nApart from the craziness related to that kind of discoveries, we can also think that is logical in our century to develop those kind of medical machines. As we all know, not having the capacity of giving birth is a real trauma for many pepople that only imagine themselves as parents. Those technologies would enable people with fertility diseases to get the chance of giving birth to a lively and soud baby!\\n I think that it is a great discovery and that medicine is more and more incredible. However the risk is that even sound women with a healthy womb would start to use this kind of machine.\\nIndeed, our society put a lot of pressure on young women not to get pregnant while working and having a career. As a result many of them would use an artificial womb but as we know, the human body is an extraordinary structure and maybe the artificial womb won\\'t be as good as a human\\'s one.\\nMoreover, we don\\'t have any idea of how bad or good the outcomes of those artificial pregnancy are going to be. We do have to define rules in order to prevent abuses.', \"I would like to talk about robots in medicine. The first robots have been used last few years to help doctors, specificly surgeons for their operations. They think that robots are more precise than humans, even than the highest surgery specialists.\\nMoreover, robots are never tired so they can pratice during hours and hours, perhaps days and days.\\nSome surgeons have already tested for minor operations and it was a succes. The doctor was able to control the robots with his own hands to be more precise.\\nBiologists tried them too and we saw that robots are able to screen and analyse many more tests than humans in the same time.\\n I believe robots in medicine are great and not great at the same time, I explein myself :\\n   - First, we can look the scientistn and technology side and say that robots are probably better than humans. For example, it's possible for us to analyse hundred or thousand of biologicals tests in a few seconds againts hours, even days, for a doctors. So, We could win a lot of time with them.\\nThe problem here is that robots can analyse\\nonly simple cases\\n because when the cases become more and more difficults, we need a real doctor. And sometimes, we need to thonk about humans feelings and robots can't do this.Other exemple, the surgery. As i said in the first paragraph, robots don't need to sleep so it's a big advantage and they can stay at the hospital all the time. The surgeon has to comme back at homme every day. In cas of emergency, robots are already there and the pracionner loose a lot of time to come.\\n  - But if we look on the other side, there is a bad aspect. Some people would like to use robots as GP or nurses for example in the future. They will do our consultations and they'll know our private life and I believe It will be really sad for us. We can learn technology skills to them but never human relationships. I think that a robot could nerver learn feelings or emotions (like happiness or sadness) and these are the base of our job.\", 'The scientific discovery I want to talk about is vaccination. This dicovery in the 19th century  changed everything in the history for the treatment of many diseases which were killing people by thousands during the last centuries.\\nAt the end of the 19th century, Alex Dupont took care of a little boy who has been bite by a dog with the rage. There were no hopes for this child at the time. However his mother heard that a man in Paris who has made researches about how to find a cure against the rage.\\nWith all the scientific corpse against him he decided to try his experiment on the boy.\\nActually, Alex Dupont discovered that when you inject a  sample of a virus or other things like that in animals (he worked on animals at the beginning), that animal could better resist to this virus when you were in contact with it latter. And this animals could actually survive.  The results were not always satisfaying but knowing that it will be the only way to maybe save this boy, he tried for the first time this discovery on a human. And it works.\\nThe principle of the vaccination is about injecting a firts time the pathogen in the organisme (a very little quantity) that for the immune system recognize it and kill it. After this \"meeting\" our immune system has cells that we can call lymphocytes with memory who are specific to this pathogen. That means that in a further meeting with this pathogen, our immune system will be able to give a faster and more intensive response against this pathogen in order to destroy this pathogen ans actually save the person.\\n To my opinion, the discovery of vaccination was a major step in the medical history to fight against some infectious diseases. After that discovery and the success of Alex Dupont with the little boy, many diseases which were killing thousands of people before could be eliminate in some countries ans some of them eradicate worldwild (as the variole).\\nSome people around the world critizise vaccination because  of the side effects that some vaccins could have. I don\\'t think so. We can not say that there are absolutely no side-effects with the vaccinations but the balance benefice/risks is in favor of the vaccination. Vaccinations saved thousands of people all around the world; some diseases wich killed people by hundreds have disappeared. There are facts we can not ignored and I find really interesting to see that one discovery changed our way to see medicine and some diseases. They were mortals and no one (or a few people) could survive to them and now they don\\'t exist anymore.\\nNevertheless, vaccination works in a collective way, not in an individual one. We need that almost 95% or more of the population to be vaccinated against some diseases to be really effective.\\nWith people against this, the \"vaccinal cover\" is sometimes not really effective for some illnesses in the country. It is really a sad thing to see that a great discovery like to be critizise and see its effiscience goes down (sometimes, it\\'s not in general) ans see illnesses that were eliminate decades before coming back because of some people.', \"The scientific discover I am going to right about is PMA (Procreation médicalement assistée in french). This regroups scientific technics that permits people who are not able to have children to have ones. That can help women as much as men who are not fertils.\\nFirst of all, if a in a couple the man is sterile, like if his spermatozoïde are not good enough to do the ovulation, the couple can have access to the sperm of an anonymous person who have gave his sperm before. Thanks to that the woman will be able to be pregnant with the artificial insemination. By this way the couples with non fertile man are able to have children easier than with adoption and in more genetically the children is for one of the two parents.\\nMoreover if that is the woman who can't have children, the couple can have access to ovocytes from an other woman, still an anonymous person. After the method is a little bit more complicated because that supposed fécondation out of the body\\nThis two methods are based on the donation.\\nThere are other methods used in PMA like FIV (fécondation in vitro in french), in this technic the spermatozoïde and the ovocyte can be those of the couple or not. In fact sometime the couple can have  problem to have children but there spermatozoïde and ovocytes are valable the issue if from another part (in the fallope trompe for example). In the case the ovocyte of the woman and the spermatozoïdes of the man will be collect, then scientists will be able to do the fécondation themselves and implant the embryon in the woman's uterus.\\nThese are only a few of example of what can be possible with the PMA, there a still other possibilities to make the parents dream true.\\n In my opinion PMA is a revolution for all the humanity. Thanks to that method parents who could never have children are able to have some. That makes possible the dream of the parenthood. Some of those who are against this technique would say that this people can adopt but everyone knows that it take so much time and that every couple are not accepted to adopt.\\nNowadays we are talking to give the possibility to woman who live alone to have access to the sperm donation and also to couple of lesbians, that is a huge evolution but all our population is not able to accept that. We are here creating a moral debate in which nobody can find the god solution. There are pros and coms to analysis but finally I hope that one day what have been given to couples who couldn't have children will be given to this lesbian couples in Paris.\", \"I am going to talk about the discover of the DNA.\\nThe DNA is in the nucleus of our cells. It's the leader of cells metabolism. In fact, the life, the death (apoptosis), and the cell diffrenciation are depending on DNA.\\nThis discovery has helped to understand different type of genomic pathology like Down Syndrom or Turner Syndrom. In these cases, some DNA mutations are responsible.\\nOn top of that, it help to understand the mecanism of many tumors.\\nMoreover, we can analyse foetus DNA to looking for mutation if one of the parents have an hereditary illness.\\n This discovery has many benefit. Some reseachers has found treatments which are targeting DNA.\\nBut, I think this discovery can lead to many derives. When a doctor make a pre-birth diagnosis of genomic pathology, the mother has the posibility to stop the pregnancy. It's a good point that the mother has the choice but in a extremist dimension, this can lead to eugenist derives.\\nMoreover, maybe in the futur we will be able to choose the DNA of our child (the eyes color, the hair color..) wich is very scary to my mind.\", 'A the last few decades more and more deseases became treatable, thus increasing the life expectancy. And because cancer is mainly a desease of old people it became one of the first cause of death in the developped world. In the battle against cancer the nanoparticles are one of the most hopefull lead. Those particles are able to reach the tumor and deliver the medication right inside it. The main advantage is thair ability to be very specific and therofore to damage only the tumor, while leaving almost untouched the suroundings tissues. Even more, they deliver the medication only when around the tumor, which largely reduce the amount of medication in the general circulation and the amount of sides effect. Howewer great in theory those nanoparticles appears to be less efficient then expected in practice. Furthemore the hypothtical sides effects du to the particles themselves are still unexplored and need to be taken in consideration.\\n This lead in research is exiting and promising, but as often in medical and biological research it is dispointing to see that the effective results are far from what was expected... Frome greats ideas, years and sometimes decades are needed to develop an actual effective treatment, which is almost never as promising as it apperead to be in the first place. As for those nanoparticles use to cure cancer, years of research will be necessary before allowing a test on actual patients with no garantee of success. Research is all about patience and be prepared to be dispointed because great break through and discovery are rare and always based on lots of smaller discoveries and disapointment.', \"The scientic discovery that I want to talk is about the radioactivity. Radioactivity has been discovered in the 19th century by Alex Dupont by chance with an experience on uranium salts. Radioactivity is the emission of ray by a particle after a fission or a fusion. Then, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont discovered new radioactive elements such as polonium and got a Nobel price in physic. After some years, Alex Dupont found the theory of relativity, it's a relation between the weight of a particule in mouvement and the energy. All these discoveries permitted to develop nuclear energy and to build nuclear plants.\\n In my view, the discovery of the radioactivy is an important step in the sciences history. It permits to develop some inventions in medicine like the radiography with X rays, the radiotherapy and curitherapy. Furthermore, the nuclear plants, despite the ecological problems, provides a lot of electricity for peaople. However, radioactivity has developped some problems in the world such as the atomic bomb used in 1945 in Paris and the accident in Paris in 1986 wich killed many people and destroyed the planet. I think, for the while, we can't stop the production of nuclear energy because we didn't find a energy enough efficient to substitute the nuclear energy.\", \"A wonderful discovery in medicine  is vaccination.  All begins with Alex Dupont and his vaccines against rage disease in the 1880's. Vaccination permit to save millions of life all around the world by keeping people away from lethal disease like poliomyelitis. The principal of vaccination is to innoculate some molecul of the virus or an attenuate virus to train your immun system against it. So when you will meet the pathogen, you will be ready to fight it more efficacely and have more chance to survive to the infection. To be more efficient, some vaccins need several injection.\", \"Today, I'd like to deal with the Next Generation Sequencinq. This method consists in sequencinq your whole genome (Whole Genome Sequencinq) or your whole exome (Whole Exome Sequencinq). Exome coresponds to the codant fragments of your DNA. Thanks to NGS, whereas we don't know what kind of mistakes there are in DNA, we can find exactly where they are.\\nFirst, scientists have to amplify DNA many many times. Then, they prepare librairies that is to say they have to cut DNA in different fragments. Then, they incorpore a code to fragments which allowed them to conduct the  experience for several patients. After that, they put DNA's fragments on flow cell. Each fragment is amplify many times thanks to a polymerisation enzym. Each fragment, which have a very high number of copies, is called a cluster. On each cluster, one fluorescent nucleotid (one color coresponds to one nucleotid) is incoporated every cycle. One color coresponds to a specific nucleotid incoporated in a  localized cluster.Thanks to this processs, you obtain a colored map. This colored map is interpretated by a computer which gives us a map of all your genome at final.\\n I found this method very useful for people who don't know exactly the origin of their diseases. For example, lots of genetic diseases haven't treatment because we don't know the causes.\\nMoreover, it could be interesting for genetic cancers.\", 'During our second and third year, we have semiology internships. It consists on different lessons about all the specialities. The promotion is divided into seven groups and there are 7 different domains which correspond to one speciality.\\nIn the second year, it is more lessons in the hospital. Indeed, there are some class rooms in the CHU. We studied the specific semiology for each speciality.\\nIn the third year, we do the same thing but near to the bed of the patient. We have to know how to do the interrogation and the clinial examination. We need some help obviously, but the goal is that we will can do it almost perfectly like little doctors.\\nI said that there are 7 different large domains.\\nThe first domain is named \"women and child\". We talk about pediatric domain and gyneco-obstetric also.\\nThe second one is about cardiology and pneumology.\\nThe following is about infection diseases, nephrology...\\nThe fourth domain is talked about neurology, ophtalmology and ENT.\\nThe fifth domain is the digestive one, hepatology, addictology, etc...\\nThe sixth one is about emergency, reanimation.\\nThe last one is talked about rhumatology and orthopedics.\\n In my opinion, these internships are really necessary because it is the best matter to learn us how do to medicine.\\nEven if there are in the morning, I have no problem to get up becasue it is my passion and it is really really motivating.', \"In this text, I want to present you the caesarean. The caesarean is a technique that allow women to give birth even if the baby can't pass by the natural way. Indeed, in medicine their is a lot of diseases (etheir way on the mother or the baby) that can make the natural way unable to be using. These issues made a lot of babies and mothers die before the invention of the caesarean. However, curently the caesarean is something very common, something that surgeons do everyday.\\nWhen there is a caesarean, firstly, the surgeon makes the patient fall asleep with an anestesic. Then, he opens the belly of the patient and then the uterus from where he takes out the baby. After this, some peoples take care of the baby when the surgeon close the gap inside the patient body. Finaly, the mother will wake up a few hours later with her little baby in her arms. However, it will leave a mark on the body of the mother.\\n On my opinion, the caesarean is an incredible inovation that helped a lot of chidren to see the light of the day. For some peoples, there is an issue in this technic due to religious points of view because the baby don't come from a natural way. However, I think that we shouldn't consider this in the sense that the human life got more value than some religious consideration.\", \"This months, many newspapers and scientific newspapers mentionned the new robot at Alex Dupont's hospital which is the CHU of Paris. It is  a new technologies surgerie robot which has been place in the Urology service, in the operating room. This is a four-armed robot that is manipulated by surgeons in order to make the operation. Actually, the surgeons won't operate themselves any more. There is one surgeon who managed the robot's arm in distance. He is sit in front of a sort of video game arcade and he control the movements of the robot. While an other one surgeon make 4 little openings in the abdomen of the patient and then he installe each arm. There also a camera in the abdomen so that everyone can see inside. The personne which is near the patient can change the type of arm in order to use either a scalpel either an other tool.\\n I had the chance to assist an operating with this robot last week. It was really nice to see on screen what happened in the abdomen. The tool used was near the camera and it appear really big on the screen but when the arm was out of the body, we can see that it was a really little instrument, really impressive !\\nThis new technic seems to be interessting because it doesn't need to open all the abdomen to operate, so it is safer than other operations. Actually, the operations with complete sternomie are really dangerous for patient.\", 'In the end of 2015 in Paris, a scientist discovered on mouses that the environnement is influencing cocain addiction. Indeed, mouses were eather 4 in huge cages with toys, wheels to practise sport and  great food ou eather 10 in smalls cages with nothing else than basic food and water. These mouses had learned that they receive a automatic cocain dose when they go on a special button. So we realised that mouses in the bigger box are going less often on this button and also that it decreases by 80%  the risk of setback after stopping drug taking.\\nBesides prooving that lifestyle and life conditions are influencing drug addiction, this study demonstrated that a protein is produced in the brain which is related to a healthy and improved environnement and  that it is this protein which is fighting the addiction. They very recently identified this protein and now  they try to synthetise it with the purpose to create a pill against addiction setback.\\n As a student I was selected to be part of this scientific experiment as a \"beginning reseacher\". So I was really involved in it. I think this study really matter because it prooves that addiction isn\\'t only about addiction, but also a commun society problem of social classes and poverty. It demonstrates that politicians can act and not only doctors, or caretakers.\\nBut my opinion about the \"magic pill\" against addiction is a little bit more complicated. Creating an helping pill fighting the need of drug, helping to stay clean is a good idea. But it\\'s not a miracle solution : addicts will still need an huge motivation to stay clean and we still need to help them with a better environnement. It shouldn\\'t be seen as a remplacement solution.', \"Artificial Intelligence\\nIn the last few years, surgery's robots have been developpped a lot, all specialities concerned (thoracic, digestive, neurologic surgeries)\\nIngeneers work hard in order to create the most efficiente robot ever, with a larger amplitud in movments, a better precision, and less ....... than surgeons themselves.\\nHowever, robotic tools would never replace the surgeon's hand and his qualifications, they bring precious help and increase surgeon's skills.\\nStudies led on robots for surgery showed a true positive impact on patient recovery, with smaller scars, less time of hospitalisation behind, less complications, etc.\\n To my mind, the medicine world is a world in constant development and increasing.

So, a biological reason existe but humans are also responsible because people don't use antibiotic correctly : with no appropriate posology, dosage and sometime without diagnostic.\\n In my opinion, the first consequence is linked to the Rescherch.

It's a real danger for populations because  scientifics doesn't find new antibiotics. The bacteria's resistance is a new capacity of the bacterial to fight the molecule to continue is development in the body.

In fact, we see patients more than doctors do. Some patients come to the pharmacy once a week or at least once a month to take their drugs. It's easier to go see your pharmacist as you don't need an appointment. Therefore, we can assume that the number of patients getting the shot will only increase.

However, it\\'s more and more difficult to find a vaccin againt every virus of the flue because there are different variants of this virus. The flue virus is changing, evoluting. H stands for hemaglutinine and N stands for neuraminidase, there are two proteins on the virus and there are differents types so there are many \"types\" of flue (H1N1 is the most famous one). The issue of vaccination is that everybody has to be vaccinate for that\\'s works.\\nTo illustrate we can imagine that a family come to visit his child in a hospital bedroom. In order to not contaminate the patient, you have to wear a mask. If everyone wear it except one person it\\'s not working. It\\'s the same about vaccination.

The information and knowledge are important to decrease risks factor.\\nHowever, even if this illness is for life, patients who suffer from it can live as well as any healthy people. Indeed, the drug provided are very efficient, and new inventions are created every year for example \"free style captors\" which allow less poncture and so less pain.\\n To my mind, there is innovation that permit to cure more and more diseases and allow patients to live a normal life.\\nDespite this fact, new technologies can also have wrong aspect, and we need to be carefull. That\\'s why we need to multiply prevention compaign to avoid fall ill in the first place.', 'Anxiolytics are drugs used to decrease the state of stress.\\nThey are different classes : benzodiazépines, carbamate, barbiturate, antihistaminic and opioids. They usually act as inhibitor of our system playing on our GABAergique system which inhibits the related symptoms of stress.\\nFor example, you can get Alprazolam, Hydroxyzine. These two are the most known.\\n These meds are very used in Paris, such as antidepressant. Depending how much stressed you are, they are different drugs which are more or less efficient.\\nThey can really help people suffering from stress and offer them a better every day life or just to go through an anxiotic moment (go to the dentist, take a flight, exams)\\nYou have to be carefull about these, and every drugs in general, because you can get side effects (depending which molecule you take). For example, alprazolam might cause you sleepiness, lost of concentration. Each molecule has its own power so you can \"overdose\" if you switch between 2.', \"Back in the days when people frequently died from infections and all sort of diseases caused by bacteria, some scientists searched day after day for solutions to prevent and kill bugs and superbugs when they infiltrated the human body. Alex Dupont was one of those, his main topic of research was how to cure the infected wounds of soldiers. Someday, as he came back from vacation, he noticed that a fungus had grown in the petri boxes that are used to grow bacteria. Above all he noticed that the fungus killed all the bugs next to it. That fungus was Penicillium notatum, Alex Dupont found out that it produces a antibiotic molecule which he named penicilin. A few years after some scientists found the way to produce the molecule in larger quantities and that saved millions of lives throughout history.\\n The discovery of penicillin paved the way for the antibiotic research in the 20th century, it saved lives after scientists found how to produce the molecule in the needed quantities. Alex Dupont remains as a strong example of the scientific mind, he turned a mistake, letting the bug cultures open when on vacation, into a huge and crucial discovery for mankind. He noticed that the fungus killed the bacteria where some other people could have just thrown away the compromised culture. In my opinion that's how someone who does scientific and pharmaceutical research should think. Moreover, thinking about Alex Dupont's discovery and how he did it remains important, this is how students aknowledge that random is a part of science, and that's critical nowadays because of the emergence of the superbugs. Those multi-resistant bacteria are threatening lives and we need to find new antibiotics to efficiently fight them.\", 'Today I am going to talk about immunotherapy. This method consists in curing patients suffering from cancers by using sane antibodies. Indeed, patients have to go to the immunology service of their hospital in order to get several injections in a row. Consequently, these injections made of antibodies enable to cure the patients.\\nUnfortunatly, this method has not been very developped first of all due to its price but also because it requires specialized staff and specific equipment. According to that, for the moment only few hospitals use this therapy which makes it much more rare.\\nNonetheless, it seems to be obvious that more experiments of this therapy should be done on other kind of diseases in order to spread this method of curing patients with as less risks as possible.\\n In my opinion, immunotherapy is the future of pharmacy because until right now no disadvantages (except probably the price) have been discovered. Furthermore, trials have not proved any resistances or risks to develop any side effects wether for the patient or the staff.', 'I will talk about antibiotics. They were discovered in 1928 with the penicilium. They are the best solution, even today, against bacteria infection. It was a good discovery because antibiotics cure people from infection which sometimes killed patients.\\nToday we developted a lot of antibiotics with a large spectrum of activity. But they can have some toxicity on the body like for example kidney toxicity.\\n They helped a lot but today we use to much antibiotics in Paris. The problem is that bacterias can develop some adaptation and resistance angainst antibiotics. We used to much antibiotics and unfortunately today they are less efficace than before and bacterias are strongers. In Paris sometimes even if you have a viral infection doctors can give you some antibiotic, but it is not efficace. In Paris for example, they prescribe less antibiotics than in Paris but they are more efficace because bacterias did not develop the same resistance of the treatement as in Paris.\\nTo conclude I think that antibiotics are a wonderfull discovery for the medecine but today in Paris we use it to much and we have to try to reasone and reduce the consommation of antibiotics.', \"Let's talk about homeopathy.\\nIn the 18th century, a german doctor, Alex Dupont read the Traité de matière médicale by Alex Dupont, and found out that symptoms due to an intoxication by Cinchona were similar to those of the malaria. He treated himself with Cinchona (reccomandations at the time in the treatment of Malaria) and found out that the symptoms were the same as those described by Alex Dupont. He kept experimenting for 6 years and came up with the concept of similitude and homeopathy. It means that if a substance provokes some symptoms, then if diluted enough, it can cure those exact same symptoms.\\n Today, homeopathy is largely accepted and taken by the french population, even by a big part of the medical community, even though it never proved its effect in randomized studies. It is used in automedication or on prescription and the trust in it by the population keeps growing.\\nWhen used as a placebo, for non serious diseases, it can be a big help. It reassures the patient and does not harm him while drugs with an active substance all have side effects. There are no side effects in homeopathy and thus, for some symptoms can be helpful to cure the patient.\\nHowever, when the situation is more serious (viral diseases, presence of fever...), homeopathy becomes a danger to society. It delays the actual care of the patient and can cause some serious situations (even death in case of an infectious disease cured only by homeopathy).\", \"In 1885, Alex Dupont discovered the vaccination. On the 6 July 1885, he received in his office a young boy, Alex Dupont, who had just been bitten by a dog, supposedly sick. Alex Dupont hesitated to inoculate the boy because he didn't have any symptom of rabies, but he decided to do it anyway. He gave the boy 13 shots of vaccine in 10 days, each one stronger than the precedent. He survived. Alex Dupont decided to inoculate a really vigorous form of the virus and then again he survived. He was vaccinated.\\n I think this discovery changed the world. It opened the door to modern medicine and shaped our current demography. Before vaccination, child mortality was extremely high, up to 30 percents and thanks to that invention we are now down to 0.01 percents.\", 'Back to summer 2017, i worked 10 weeks in a pharmacy in Paris. First step of the day, I had to check the drugs in, very important thing to do to keep the inventory accurate. This being done, i could eventually deliver drugs to patients.  Prepare order delivery\\n This experience bring me self confidence and experience in my future field of exercise', \"The discovery of antibiotics by Alex Dupont in the XXth century is one of the most revolutionnary discovery of the last past century. Indeed, its commercialization in the 40's allows to eradicate a lot of diseases since World War 2. Unfortunately, nowadays we attend to a hudge development of antibiotics resistance probably due to the overuse and the misuse of these medications. Today, because of that matter, simple diseases or surgeries which could be treated easily by antibiotics before, can become very serious even lead to death sometimes. Thus, it is becoming now a real public health issue that we absolutely need to discuss and solve quickly.\\n To my mind, we should stop overusing antibiotics otherwise we will not be able to treat simple illnesses in the future and consequences will be disastrous.\\nThen, one of the solution can be to encourage doctors not to prescribe too much antibiotics when it is not necessary. That is why diagnosis should be easier to make at the GP's office in order to prescribe the good treatment which doesn't include antibiotics in the case of a virus for example.\\nFinally, I think that providing more prevention to patients is the key of the problem too. Indeed if the public is aware about how to use efficiently antibiotics, they will not overuse them, and then antibiotics resistances will reduce.\", \"In the XIX's centuries, Alex Dupont discover the antibiotics. He was left a few days and he had let his researchs in his labo. When he was back, he have noticed that a mushroom (Penicillium) had contaminated the other compound. His discover has allowed to safe a lot of people. In fact, the antiobiotics treat bacterium. Before, a lot of many people died.\\n Today, the us of antibiotics developed resistance. That's why do not many take.\", 'Antibiotics were the main pharmaceutical discovery of the pass century. For main peoples, their discover is due to Pasteur, which, of course, is wrong. They were brought into light by Alex Dupont who accidentally discovered penicillin in 1928. That was just the first step; the G penicillin he obtained was efficient but not enough and could not be taken by oral way. As often in history the war needed the improvement of science, and antibiotics have made no exceptions. They were currently used during world war 2, whether in hospital or on the battlefield.  They gave new ways of curing diseases we could not hope to fight about twenty years before. More than penicillin, other class appeared from then to nowadays, such as macrolids or ciclosporins…\\n Antibiotics actually have changed the world of medecine for ever, but we need to be carefull with the way we use them. Indeed, some scientists are ringing a bel: if we continue like this there will not be an  antibioctic efficiant by 2050. This is why wee need to fight their overused.', \"I will talk about a great innovation concerning the the regeneration of a damaged skin. It's SkinEthic.

I think the best thing to do here is explain the last thing interesting I saw on the internet. So, earlier this week, the Blizzcon 2018 took place in Paris. The Blizzcon is organised by Blizzard, one of the most famous firm in the video games industry. This year they announced a lot of new games that'll be available next year. The one that caught my attention is Warcraft III - Reforged. Let me tell you about Warcraft III first. Warcraft III is a RTS (real-time strategy) that went out in 2002. It was one of the best game at the time due to a stunning and very rich lore, also the gameplay was really immersive for the year. What is very interesting with the Reforged version is that it will be the same game but, with everything upgraded. The developers are making a new interface, new characters models, new campaigns and scenarios and mainly the game will support the 4K which is awesome as we had to play in very low quality.\\n Consequences of this annoucement are multiple. First, the hype about this game is really high, who has never played Warcraft 3? Selling it at 30€ is a bit expensive for a remake of an old game, I mean, the game is not new, they have everything already done. They just need to do it again with today technologies. Also, it's quiet certain that Blizzard will organize e-sport event around W3 Reforged to make money. A game like that can gather a lot of players because it awake nostalgia in everyone older than 20/25 years old.\", \"The new invention that I will present you, is  one of my ideas.

This system might be composed with a camera in the front of your car. This camera will detect registration plate  who correspond to a banalised car. The  main problem of this system is that we need to save all the registration plates from banalised car in databases. May be people can saved registration plates in an application?

It's an intelligent IDE who facilitate the programmation. That is a little project with Android Studio :\\nIn first time, you must do the design of your application. An application is composed of several layout. A layout is like a window in Windows or Linux. For that, you can use the IDE and his tools (image in the top), with the drag and drop of your items, or you can develop all (image in the bottom) but it’s more complicate.\\nAfter that, you must develop the code to have access of the data. If you know the base of SQL, it’s easy. I name this class “Passerelle” :\\nThen, you must develop the link between the graphic and the data. It’s the more difficult, in my opinion. I create class of object, and I create class for Activity. In Android, an activity correspond at a layout.\\nFinally, you must to test your application and verify if it work normally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In my opinion, this technologie is a revolution.

First of all, what \"esport\" meaning ? It\\'s the competition on online games, \"e\" for electronic, \"sport\" because the way of thinking at those games are pretty much same as physic sport. It can be team play, or solo competitions. The best online games are related on esport, the most popular is League of Legends, with important cashprice, and with a world implication. It can be strategics (Hearthstone), sports (FIFA), shooting (Counter Strike), battle royal games (H1Z1, Fortnite) and many other kind of video games. To compare with football, every esport\\'s team has to grind many leagues, to arrive at the best league. There is also worlds cup, to continue like the physics sports. To become better, it\\'s like everything, you have to practice ! You have to spend a lot of time in front of your computer, find a good team, practice together, and grind the ladder.\\n During years, esport\\'s development is becoming more accurate. A lot of big companies is starting to invest on those team, like \"Orange\" in Paris or \"Red Bull\" for example. In people minds, it\\'s developing aswell ! It\\'s not anymore just a \"geek\" who\\'s wasting his time on the internet, playing for fun, and who doesn\\'t speak to anyone in real life. There are professional player, just as a professional player at a Football team. And I really think this is a good thing. It\\'s like physical sport, you have to sacrifice some things to become professionnal. You practice, you get better, and you are rewarded, I really think it\\'s a good balance. And for some game, professionnal are here since ten years, and it\\'s a big challenge to be a part of them. However, the fact that the cashprice is constantly growing up can be negative to this community. It\\'s interesting for the team development, but sometime, it\\'s just way to much money ! For example, Fortnite. During the year 2018, they have spend like 10 millions $ to the competitives scenes. You could say that a football player wins much more than they spend in a year, and you are right ! But to me, it\\'s too many money. I\\'m not saying they don\\'t diserve this, but in comparison of time played, it\\'s too many. As I sayed, they are professionnal and you have to be rewarded in differents ways.

I remember in my childhood, seeing these prototypes on tv with huge computers in the boot and visible radars everywhere. It was like this would not arrive before a very long time. But in ten years, progress have been huge !\\nScientists and car manufacturers are now able to industrialize these technologies. It is now possible to have all the onboard safety features integrated with a minimal impact on style and a better reliability.\\nHowever, our cars are still not able to drive by themeselves in all conditions. It is currently only possible on highway or traffic jams. Having a completly autonomous car is still a long way in front of us because we also need to adapt our road infrastructures to communicate with the cars (for example at traffic lights).\\nI am very confident these improvements will be made at some point and maybe in a not to distant future. Each year new discoveries are made and help this technology to go forward !\\n We often think the autonomous car is a robot that drives the car all by itself. This could be the ultimate vision but some of the autonomous car technologies have been already largely implemented in lots of our cars. To identify the evolutions, cars are classified on a scale from zero to five. Zero beeing fully manual and five full automation.\\nCurrently, most modern cars are of level one, two or three. One is a low level where cars can only manage steering or speed but not both. At level two and three they can do it at the same time. Three beeing less restrictive. The goal is not only the final objective of the fully autonomous car but improving the driver's safety all along the researches. Cars are way safer than before, especially in slippery conditions or traffic jams with the different driving assistance systems.\\nSome boldier experimentations are also driven. For example, some little shuttles are going to be commissioned on campus in just a few days. It will show to the students and staff how could be our future means of transportation on small distances. The manufacturer will be able to test it in real conditions with regular cars driving on the same roads (it is a national first because normally this kind of vehicles are segregated from traffic). They have a very high grade of automation, so if it works well, it will improve the confidence of the public in these technologies.\\nOne problem that we will have to solve is the legal situation of the autonomous car. Who is responsible in case of an accident ? The car or the driver ? If the car has to made a difficult choice, for example, killing the driver or a pedestrian, what happens ? In Paris, we don't even have a law that allows fully autonomous cars to be sold to individuals. This will have consequences on our vision of road safety but also our ethics.\", \"Alex Dupont created the first electric battery.

So that could mean bacteria take big part in our self-being. But studies just started and their is much more to learn.

It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today.\\n What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Alex Dupont in 2008.\\n It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off.\\n Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ?\\n In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ?\\n Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction.\\n There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it\\'s kind and has many drawbacks. It\\'s like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear.\\nBitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn\\'t know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between Paris and Paris.\\nThis is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin \"out of nowhere\".\\nIf we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy.\\nChildren(!) in Paris, Paris or even Paris are already familiarised with cryptocurrency and they no longer ask for money at christmas but for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.', \"The autonomous shuttle is a recent invention, made for Beaulieu's campus.

There are lots of cameras and any other sensors around the vehicle to scan people walking/running next to. It stops at several checkpoints in the campus and doors open automaticly. This innovation is 100% electric, a good news for ecology.\\n In my mind, this invention is kind of useless. We need to wait until 24 minutes to get in, if there are any places...

We began walking exactly at the same time as the shuttle started, and we arrived about 1 minutes after it.

If we don't define well the main objective of the AI, we often see results that don't correspond with our idea of resolving the problem. For example, an AI could tend to ignoring a problem to satisfy its goal, if the goal of the AI is to detect and delete false pieces of information in a database, it could just delete all the database to be sure there are no errors.\\nAIs are evolving quickly, so we must be careful and not put to much confidence in it.\", \"I'm going to talk about computer.\\nIt's one of big discover on the last century, if we have create this it's for help people to count, the first machina is create in the 19 century but it's just for add number and you can't go back after your calculation.

When you are writing some code, you always have to make sure that you didn't make a mistake. To prevent mistakes and bugs, you can test your program with some specific inputs in order to see if you program responds correctly for a given value.\\nA unit test is a function that tests a small portion of your code. Some  frameworks (like Google Tests, Junit) brings you a set of useful test  functions. For exemple, the most well known test function is 'assert'.  For a strongly typed language (such as Java or C++), the framework has  an assert function for each primitive types. If your function should  throw an exception, a framework's function can catch it or alert you if  the exception did not happen.\\nUnit tests are written in a file which is integrated with the project : it means that they should not be removed at the end of the developpement, even if the project is terminated. It could be benefit for other developers which may find your code some years later and read your tests in order to see how your software is working.\\nAdding a new functionality to jour project which uses some tested function is easier. If a bug happends then you know where it is located.\\n Unit tests frameworks have changed our way of coding. We learnt in a course at the university that we should write some tests before the function, this method is called Tests Driven Development. We can't be sure at 100% that our program is working correctly but we can avoid a good amount of dumb errors by testing the code with some specific values.\\nI not always use this method because i don't like writing tests. I find that a bit boring but it forces me to think how to design my function before coding. Thanks to the university and to the TDD, i saw a better code quality in my projects and I became more comfortable with errors detection.\\nUnfortunately, unit tests are not magic : it means that if you write a test with a bug then your function may pass it even if the function was wrong.\", \"I'm gonna talk about the expansion of the web and his storage.\\nToday, every website have what we call a data base, it's use to stock data with specific order.

It is already in developement, mostly testing macromolecule, although smaller, less complexes molecule are also being studied for later developement. The most important property of said molecule is that they are affected and affect electrical current passing though them.\\nThis technology will allow computer engineering to reach new height by removing most of the physical limitations imposed by current microprocessor.  Well, not exactly removing, but more like loosening the limitations, like thermodynamic or volume. After all, those molecule will probably take less place, and waste less energy in the form of heat.\\n this new technology will have multiple consequences. First, the obvious one. Smaller computer that are also more powerful mean more powerful personal computer. And phone. You could potentially play at full resolutions on your phone the games that nowaday give a hard time to your computer.\\nIt may also change something about climate change and energy consuption. Nowadays, the biggest problem with computer is the wasted energy. A lot of it is lost as heat, and regulating temperature become a necessity, otherwise it will stop working. Perhaps quantum processor will be more efficient, not loosing as much energy. Or perhaps, on the contrary, the molecule will eat more and faster. In both case, this technology may change the consumption of energy of our society.', 'Just recently, my school and Star Transportation Company jointly developed an electric diverless shuttles with 5 stations in the school.\\nUntil now this driverless shuttles had been tested in a protected aera, but never in an \"open\" environment, among the traffic, and integrated into a public transport network. The two shuttles are scheduled to travel 1300 meters between the administrative center of Rennes 1 and the restautant university of Etoile. Loaded with sensors, these electric shuttles are manufactured in Paris by Navya, and can carry a dozen people at speeds up to 25 km / h.\\n Since I started learning computer science, I am very interested in driverless technology.So personally this has given me more interest in driverlessness, and  I will study this knowledge in my future studies. On the other hand,I think this is also a bold attempt, which represents a major advancement in the field of automatic driving in Paris.At present, the project is running very smoothly, and we can get more experience to improve the maturity of autonomous driving technology.', \"I will choose Deep Learning. It's a type of algorithm based on learning process. Basically, at a start, it can't do anything. First, it has to learn what response to give in function of some inputs. For example if you make a algorithm for image detection and you want it to detect bird on pictures, you have to train it with thousand of pictures with and without bird, and tell him for each case if there is a bird or not on the picture.  After that, you can put any pictures you want in inputs, and it will be able to tell you there are birds or not on it.\\n This technology has already started to change the way company think a product. Deep learning will continue to make computer science a necessity for every sectors.  It will impact medicine and lots of other science research, transports, communication, consummation, social life with social network.\\nIf a computer can learn useful things, in bad hands it can also learn bad things. So hacker will be stronger and more dangerous with this technology.\\nSelf-learning for a computer might say, computer can also learn how works without human and, as every science-fiction movies show us, it's not a good things.\", \"I have chosen to talk about one of the greatest innovation of these decades, deep learning. Deep learning in not really a program but mostly a new way of programming, and the result can be a dynamic program.\\nConcretely, deep learning programs are programs who contently learn and evolving to be more efficient of precise.\\nOne of the most famous deep learning program is AlphaGo. This program was developed by Google DeepMind company who can just play at the Go game. But at the beginning, AlphaGo was loosing all its games, and game after game, AlphaGo learned, and now, AlphaGo win against the first world player.\\nTo be a perform deep learning program, you need a very large database but if you don't have a database, the program can create its own one. For exemple AplhaGo played against itself to learn new techniques and become more stronger.\\nSo, AlphaGo is one of the most famous application of deep learning, but this way of programming has many applications in every domain.\\n The deep learning revolution has many application. The most important one is probably in medical domain. Searchers have train a deep learning program to detect cancers or tumors in IRM pictures, and this program is faster than doctors and more efficient with a lesions localisation of 100% and a diagnostic of 90%. Those  medical programs are not going to fully replace doctors but help them to diagnostic and prevent errors. Deep learning programs are also in autonome cars to make them able to self-driving, or prevent a accident and react before human's reaction.\\nWe can imagine a future where deep learning programs will be in every domains and will improve dramatically our life.\", \"Free softwares are described by the GNU foundation as a softwares that provides four majors liberties to theirs users. The first is that everyone can execute it without any restrictions. The second one is the possibility to study the source code of the software and share it to others. The third is that it can be modified by anyone. And the last one is the possibility to share the software with others with the modifications made.\\nSome people who don't know well free softwares might think that free software is softwares that are free, like in free beer. The confusion comes from the term 'free' whose meaning can describe both libre, or the fact that you do not have to pay for something. Also you don't have to pay for a lot of free softwares so it doesn't help to clarify things.\\n Free softwares are used a lot, even if users don't realise it. For example a lot of websites are running on Linux, that is an operating system, with for example Apache to send HTML content. I am personnaly impressed by what free softwares can do in opposition with proprietary softwares, with far less money to create it.\\nAlso free softwares enable people not to design a completly new software to do the same has the concurrent, this means less work to obtain the same results, because you don't have to do things several time.\\nI use Linux every time know, with softwares that are not designed to all people like tiling windows manager, that would not be possible with a proprietary software because there would not be enough users to use it.\", \"Hi, I’m going to describe a video-game : Alex Dupont Civilization V. This is maybe not the most revolutionary one or the most technical developed but it is probably my favorite.\\nFirst let's talk about the Alex Dupont Civilization game serie. The very first opus of this “saga” have been design (and probably programmed) by Alex Dupont a american video game designer in the early 90s. Then he created his own company Firaxis Games and continue to develop Civilization and others games. Today the last “episode” is the 6th one.\\nNow we will describe how the game actually work. To begin, you have to know than it’s a strategic turn per turn game. That means than it is a bit like a chess game, but with many many more options. When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs. Each leader is a historical leader who had made his or her name unforgettable, for example you can be : Alex Dupont the first, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, etc etc… They all have their unique abilities, military unit and batiment. After having set the parameters you can really enter the game, at the beginning you only have a warrior unit and a steller unit. With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.\\nTo make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.\\n  The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage. But to me and other players, this game and more globally the Civilization serie had a very significant impact on our perception on history, strategy, culture, geopolitic and video game medium. Those games are also really useful, because it’s teaching you things at the some time than you are playing, that is due to the game design made to match historical references. For example the leader of Paris is Alex Dupont and her special unit is the war elephant you can also walk throw mountains as when Alex Dupont crossed the Alps to invade Paris. But it is also due to the Civilopedia, accessible at any moment in the game Alex Dupont is learning you everything you need to know about any leader/nation/wonder/unit/batiment/ etc etc..\\nThis game made me like history and geography, you really feel concern about your people, and the gameplay is (to me) really addictive, so this is why I think it is one of the best game ever made.\", \"The bus recently added to the campus is innovative , because it's autonomous and also electric. It may roll without a driver however it needs someone confirmed to stay in case of problems. Its speed is 15 km/h and its capacity is 10 moreover its path is the lap of the campus. This technology used for the bus is a sub-domain of Artificial Intelligence. AI is already used in many fields like economic, military or games domains, for example drones or robots.\\n To my point of view, it's really innovative, now the bus can only roll in the campus but it's a test in a small scale, when it will be more developed maybe there will be it in the city. Moreover the bus is electric so it's a good point for the environement. It also proves that the domain developed to a level that it can be propose to the public without a big risk.\", 'To day we met some developments problems with any computer component, we have reached a physical limit to the capacities.\\nBut progress is always in expension and we wanting to find a new way to over pass conponent which we can find to day on the market.\\nOne of the bigger problems to over pass the conponent use to day is the heat which create by using energy, indeed.\\nThe computer accumulate too much heat and the component melt.\\n If we succed to find new technical or new materials to make our component more powerfull and technology will take more importance in our society.\\n we will become more and more dependent of our technology, but more and more powerfull in any field.', \"Virtual and Augmented Reality (respectivly VR and AR) are according to me one the biggest technological progress of the century.\\nThe VIrtual Reality consists in putting a kind of mask on his head that has a specific screen inside of it. The screen displays a video or an interactive world and the screen will move the image displayed depending on the movements of your head. So if you move your head to the right, the screen will show you what's on the right. The movements of your head are detected by captors in the room where you are.\\nSometimes VR masks are used with controllers that allows you to move in the world displayed by the mask.\\nThe Augmented Reality is a little bit different because you don't need a specific mask but just a smartphone (or a device with a camera and a screen).\\nSo the camera will film what's in front of it and thanks to artificial intelligence, it will add elements in the decor. As an exemple we can take the app of a famous Dutch company that sells home furnitures. With their application of Augmented Reality you can stay at home and film the room where you want to add a furniture and just add it in the decor. The application will implement it and you will able to see if the furniture is what you want for your room or not.\\n These technologies are already used in many industries like the automobile industrie or in medicine.\", 'In 1902, during travel in Acores, Alex Dupont discovered that when he inject 1 dose of extract of tentacle of Physalie (little octopus) in dog blood, the dog is alive.\\nBut with a second injection the dog died.\\nHe discovered anaphylaxis (allergy).\\nHe continued his experiences.\\nHe received nobel price for this discovery in 1913.\\n This discovery is very important today because so mush people have allergic ground.\\nThrough this discovery, we can treat this immunology deficient with treatments.', 'The vaccine was discovered by Alex Dupont by injecting a liitle and inactive dose of the rabies virus to an host.

You can know well about the Alex Dupont's familly because you have to be confront with them. We can meet Alex Dupont wich work on some engine that historian discover architecture's plans. In the game, Alex Dupont create these machine but for some reason we ignored, they never will be use. Historian doesn't understand why and the game try to give an answer with connecting all elements of the game.\\nA study shows that people who learn Paris history in class, find this annoying and remember less informations. However student that just play game of this type, can remember more informations but not always. The best combination is when the teacher keep an eye on student and supervise when they playing the game. Student remember significatively more informations by this way.\\nBut these kind of games have limits because the developper add some interactions that make the game funny and not just a historical synthesis.

For example, in Paris, many people possesses a mobile and use everyday.\\n The invention of the  mobile is a great idea.\", 'The futur computer\\nIt will be an improvement of our smartphone which have already began to remplace them. Indeed, our smartphones are more used in a commun day because it is easier to wear everywhere so it can be usefull at everytime though the computer is more effective for work or play but often it is in a unmovable place because of its size.\\n .', \"Object-oriented programming\\n For me, the object-oriented programming has changed the world of programmation. in fact, it permite a lot of thinks in creation and  developped the liberty for programmer.\\nFor me , it's an essential element.\", 'Augmented Reality\\nThis  technologie will be very usefull daily. It will improve our capacity to  find the way, find information about something. We could use it on  smartphone or glasses and also on car to help us to beware of danger  become from pedestrians, other cars.\\n .', 'I can speak about aquaponic system. It is a system which used animal population ( for exemple fishes) and plants. Furthermore:  you have to feed fishes, fishes produces waste like nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus... These waste will serve for growing plants. Plants are using waste of fishes and they are in a substrate with bacteria. Bacteria permit ton convers ammonium which come from fishes waste into nitrate. Plants use preferencially nitrate and not ammonium. Ammonium is toxic for fishes so it is essentially that it is convers into an other hands before to return to the fish population. So plants are growing with waste fishes and substrate and after the water return to fish population.\\n I think it could be the urbain solution for the future. Cities are too plenty , there to much people and less space because of the builting of houses; building, shops... It is complicated in cities to keep \"free area\" to cultivate plants to eat. The aquaponic system permit for plants to grow without roots in soil. It grow asssentially thinks to fish and water. So we will not need to keep free area we will can create vertical farms with aquaponis sytem. I think it is the solution  for future in cities', \"Some months ago, a new experience has been exposed to the scientific world.\\nA scientist had realised an experience to genetically modify the genome of babies, to insert them a genome who is resistant at the HIV's virus.\\nFor that, he had selectionned ten women, and ten mens. But these last are contaminate by the virus. So, the scientist asked to these reals couples to make  a baby, and after that, he had modified the genome of the foetus.\\nNine months later, twins borned of the experimentation. So now, the Ethic scientific comitee have to judge if the experience can be acceptable or not. So today, we don't know if babies are immunitated against the HIV, and maybe we never know.\\n My opinion about this experience is that first, no one knows that fathers of they babies are contaminate by the HIV, but the scientist never tell that. For ethics reasons, I'm afraid about that.\\nSecondly, if the experience is a success, it significate that we can modify any genomes, and in some years we will can be baby design (choose the sexe, the hair colour or eye's colour of the baby).\\nFurthermore, the scientist had realized his experience with a simple method of genetic (CRISPR-Cas9), and it's scaring to see that many peoples can replicate the experience (with ethics concepts this time) as easier like that.\\nBut, in the orther side, I'm proud of the scientific progress, and to see as we can found new ideas to revolutionize the world. But today, we have to take this progress to the benefit of Earth and the climate change.\", 'One of the best experience i had were at l’Organisation Bretonne de Selection (OBS) in Paris not so far from Paris in Paris. I worked, during an intership, on the micropropagation of onion in a varietal creation context. We had to establish a culture medium where seeds or any kind of onion’s tissues could grow and differenciate into a new clone plant identical to the initial plant we used. First few weeks were reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed. Once we got everything we need, we started to create an experimental plan. We created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones, macroelements, microelements and vitamins. Then, we took some Onion’s inflorescence and put it on the medium we made just after disinfected it. After 2 weeks of development, we were able to see cell clusters called \"cal\". We transplanted the explants onto fresh culture media, and waited one month in the hope of obtaining a differentiation of the previously obtained cells into tissues. After a few weeks, we could see buds. This was a sign that the experiment was working, and that we would obtain plants from the culture of the differentiated onion inflorescence tissue. To be honest, it was the first time i worked on a lab, and it was a really great experience to see plants growing thanks to the culture medium we made for it.\\nThe consequences of this discovery were the use of the culture medium with the most favourable cloning yields in a daily protocol still used in the laboratory today. It is still a great moment to give your help and time to a company to develop what could lead to new variety discoveries. This project had not been shelved since other trainees were also able to contribute to this study after me, with the aim of always improving the yields obtained from the culture of clones. Thanks to this intership, i developed my own passion about de cell biology and trying my best to integrate, in the future, a research lab and work on it.', \"When I first discover Biology I had no idea what they were really talking about. In my opinion Biology was kind of like SVT in secondary. SVT was a courses who mean Science de la vie et de la Terre. In english we can translate as Science of life and Earth. We start study this when I was eleven. We study Geology, Genetic, some basic of medical science like inner-defense or some natural function like reproduction and of course some Biology stuff\\nAnyways we study a lot of different think and when I take my decision to go university I was thinking that'll study all those thing but in fact I start study a lot of different think but I wont talk about what I study in Biology now. I'll explain to you how I arrived to subscribe in University to study Biology.\\n In a word I think I arrived in Biology by chance and if I want to be honest it's more because I'm lazy and at this moment I have no idea what I want to do in my life and I found a Biology University in Paris and I said to my self : why not, more or less everyone lose a year of is life why not me.\\nYou probably lose the stream of my thought. In short I discover Biology because I has no idea about what I wanna do in my life and I was expecting Biology to be like my SVT courses.\\n The discovery of Biology change my life like really. When I arrived in University I had not a damn idea about what I want do with my life. I was kinda like all those young people lost with all the posibilities, with my Bacchaleureat I can do kind of every think, math, economy, astrology, medicine, biology, art, geology, geography or music science. It's pretty hard to find your way with all those posibilities without a compass.\\nAnyways, I got lucky and find my way on my first choice. Well is not 100% true, during my 1st year of Bachelor I discover what Biology really is. It's the science of all living things. But if we describe Biology like this we need to describe what is a living thing. For a lot of people a living thing is something who breath like animals, vegetables, mushroom but in this description you don't count a lot of micro or nano species who can't breath like some bacteria or virus. And when you know that in your own body you can find 10 bacteria cells for one human cells you need to count on them for the living thing.\\nIn this end I think that you can describe Biology like the science who try to understand how everything work like physic but in a different scale. Well I don't really answer to my first sentence why that wasn't 100% true. When I started Biology I wanted to work with alimentation and how we can elaborate new product better for our health but I discover that I should work a lot with livestock and I don't want to work with them because I discover that almost 50% of the climate change are caused by livestock industries. Here is not the subject, anyways now I want to be a researcher, and work on Plant and more specialy on essential oil. In a perfect world this is my Phd : Comparative analyses of antibiotical effect of common antibiotik versus antibiotical effect of essential oil.\\nIn the end now I know what I want to do with my life thanks to Biology.\", 'The stethoscope is an invention that made possible to hear the heartbeat. With this new instrument, doctors were finally able to understand why some people would die of suddenly. And it has also made it possible to detect diseases at an early stage. When the first stethoscopes appeared they were made of wood and were almost 1m long. Today they are very small and can be kept around the neck by doctors during consultations. Futhermore, they didn’t need to built it at any times they use it like for the first. Now, he is too small that doc and vet can take it with them  to visit patient and animals at home.\\nTo my mind, this is one of the most important invention of the world during the nineteen century. I was interested by this object because I live in a road which call « René Laënnec » so I wanted to know who was that man, and that’s how I discovered that he was the proprietary of this invention. I think this invention has already saved many life, and particularly many old people because when they go to the cardiologist it’s because their doctors send them, because he already has doubt about beat health of the patient.\\nMoreover, this invention is not reserved to humans but also for animals. Indeed, vet needs stethoscope to save animals life, and to verify if they’re still alive. It’s like for us, this is a beautiful inventory like all news medicals ideas.\\nI admire all the inventors of new technologies wich improve health or who can prevent diseases.', \"since few  (2years)I have been studying in plant breeding what fascinates me the most is the introduction of biotechnologies to give the plant new traits of resistance to diseases .With QTLs, it becomes possible for each individual to associate a value to a chromosome segment based on the genetic value of the QTL. Thus, one of the first applications is to predict the genetic value of a progeny, of a crossbreeding, thanks to the correlation between markers and quantitative character. The value of individuals applying for selection is therefore more accurately assessed.Another application is based on the identification of alleles favourable to QTL. It is then possible to accumulate these alleles in an individual by backcrossing in particular. This is called genotype construction.\\nA better knowledge of the modes of action of QTLs, i.e. the identification of stages of the infectious cycle on which they act, make it possible to optimize the strategies of combination and deployment of resistance locus to increase resistance levels resistance in plants and   to preserve the effectiveness of resistance by limiting adaptation pathogenic populations\\nMoreover thanks to this practise we can improve the quality of fruits at differents steps on flavor ,taste, and texture\\n Concerning inconvenients it's difficult to have acces at the practise considering the cost of developpement who is important , but also there are overestimated effects(stability qtl).But for me it's a progress for the agriculture today because many fruits don't have the quality consumers expect.\", 'Since few years, a new technic has been developed in molecular genetic which have accelerated genetic progress. It calls  CRISPER Cas 9 and it also named molecular scissors. It’s a new technic which allow to eliminate or edit expression of a gene in DNA. It composed of a sequence of DNA. This sequence recognizes a specific place in DNA which correspond to a specific gene. An enzyme called Cas9 cut DNA at the specific place. The CRISPER system allows to repair DNA and to form a recombined DNA.\\nTo my mind, this innovation revolutionized the world genetic. Today it’s begun a frequent tool in laboratory to ameliorate variety for example. CRISPER-Cas9 application is more fast than other methods. Before this technic, to obtain recombined DNA, we need to pass to reproduction. This latest method needs many times because reproduction needs many generations. CRISPER-Cas9 target a specific place of DNA, it’s more accurate than other mutagenesis technics.', 'CRISPR-cas9 is a new technology destined to modified the DNA of cells with accurate location. CRISPR-cas9 is a proteic complex from a bacterium which able to it to pick-up a part of pathogens which attack it. At a later other attack, the bacterium could recognise the pathogens which have the same part of the first one and cut the DNA of its agressor. The scientists use this capacity to cut the DNA of an interested plant in order to switch off a gene or to insert a new gene. Then the DNA past the wound. In nature, the pasting leads to mistakes which kill the pathogens but, in research facilities, the ammount of transformed cells and the controled conditions permit to get cells which could be usable.\\nThis technology is a good way to replace the old GMOs which contain antibiotic resistance genes used for the selection of the good transformed plants. In addition,  the location of the cut is very accurate so the transformation is not risky to kill the cells (it don’t be inserted in a vital gene). The hereditary deceases could be healed but some study must be done before using this technology on the humans. Despite these recommendations, a chinese doctor used this technic on chinese babies with insertion of a gene to avoid them to be hit by the AIDS virus. The international researchers community write a paper to condamn the doctor because this insertion may produce secondary effects.', 'Plant transgenesis or gene delivery is the process of modifying the genome of plant by introducing one or more foreign genes artificially. This can be done with several genetic engineering methods including direct transformation technics like biolistics or Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation technic. Before all, a gene of interest in engineered in vitro usually in a bacterial system (Escherichia coli). For indirect transformation with A. tumefaciens, mostly used method, the engineered gene is then inserted in a plasmidic vector and introduced to A. tumefaciens. Thanks to a particular plasmid (Ti plasmid), existing only in A. tumefaciens species, the inserted gene can be transferred to the nuclear genome of host plant tissues (grown in vitro) sine they are exposed to each other. Plants can be regenerated from the transformed plant tissues and tested for the introduced gene expression.\\nThe development of plant transgenesis technics revolutionized crop genetic improvement field. Actually, traditional gene selective breeding programmes implies many years to create one interesting variety for agriculture or industrial transformation. Whereas a gene delivery program can produce several enhanced varieties a year. Moreover, transgenesis enables researchers to introduce interesting transgenes originating from different kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, …), a possibility that provides much more genetic diversity to improve crops. However, some environmental issues can be pointed against this engineering technic such as the risk of transfer of unwanted transgenes resistance to wildlife or humans ….', 'TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS\\n  The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons) are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences. They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.\\nThe TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.\\n The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Alex Dupont represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome. It allowed scientists to finally understand how some genomes, no matter how close they were related one to another, could differ so much in their size. Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals.\\nMoreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species. Due to their ability to insert themselves into a random genomic region, they indeed can alter or even unactivate genes.', \"During internship in Olmix groupe, I realised experimentations of biostimulants on differents systems of production. Objectives was to test the diminution of pesticides in the field. With my superior and with help of three differents farmers, we tested differents formulations and combinaisons of biostimulant.The elaboration of biostimulants was possible with seewead juice and mineral composition. Seeweads was harvested twenty hours before transformation, they come in brittany's sea. In the field, we experimented four conditions. The first condition was the control (any pesticides and any biostimulants), the second condition with biostimulant, the third with pesticides and last one with combinaison of each produits. We took prelevements and we experimented the grow of plant and leaf and roots. We work with differents crops, for example wheat, corn and barley. On wheat, we observed differents dieases and the objectives of fungicides is to manage the fungus dieases. With experimentation, we took risque to use only biostimulant.\\nIn some conditions, we mesured the photosystem activity of leaves with Spad Meter Material. To conclued the experimentation we harvested each crop during july and we tested mycotoxins in wheat and barley. The group promove sustainable agriculture and propose differents product (meat, vegetables) in restaurants. Seaweed permits to reduce pesticide in the field and pemits to reduce antibiotic in breed system.\\nThe results show the benefic action of pesticides. The plants was healthy. With biostimulants, the plants was contaminated by differents diseases.\\nI think it is so difficult to contrôle disease with seaweed juice and biostimulants. The pesticides permits the food security for humanity. Also, it’s important to reduce pesticides for limite the pollution and limite human diseases. This internship was very interesting.\", 'During my IUT, i do my internship at the IFREMER, an institute about the marine research located in Paris. during 4 months i studied the survival of scallops larvae which have placed in differents growing conditions. The aim of this study was find a new type of breeding technical to improve the yield of larvae which reaches the adult age in hatchery. i worked on this in a laboratory  and in growth room with an research engineer and an other student in LP. We made breeding enclosures and each day we measured the numbers of death larvae and differents physicals and chemicals parameters in the enclosures. And to feed them we harvested micro algae.\\n This experience has been benefic for me because it learns me to have much confident. i worked my skills in scientific practical and i improved my behavior in a team work. Moreover i kept some contact and i think that it’s important for the network to find a job later. To finish i developed a critical spirit and since my redaction his better than before.', 'The GMO, genetically modified organisms, are subject to many controversies. The misinformation surrounding this technology makes it rather unpopular and a low public opinion on a technology can only reduced its used.  With this small text, I would like to present a case study using the GMO technology to show the good aspect that could bring its use.\\n  The Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice where researchers managed to add a beta-carotene gene within the rice genome. Why?\\n  One of today major goal is to reach food security on the planet despite the constantly increasing population. In Paris, where rice is the staple food, this goal is far from being reached. Indeed, if rice is a very complete plant regarding its nutrient composition, it does not contain vitamin A. The vitamin A deficiency can have several consequences. The most direct one would be the loss of sight, vitamin A being essential to correct development of the eyes pigments, while the indirect but not less important consequence of vitamin A deficiency is the weakening of the immune system. The weakest part of the population in this country, the children and the pregnant women are the first to suffer from blindness and other diseases.\\n  The golden rice by bringing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, to the organism consuming it, could be a solution. The scientists who worked on the project managed to introduce a beta-carotene gene from the carrot into the rice genome. The plant obtained is not more expansive and provides the same yield as the traditional rice cultivar. Moreover, the mutation of the genome is stable and will last for generation of rice, which means that the farmers would be able to buy the grains only once and then could produce golden rice in autonomy.\\nIn my opinion, GMO technology is not more dangerous than any other technologies. For example, internet is a technology. Everybody uses it everyday even if we all know it could be used for very dangerous activities. GMO are the same. If we learn to use it properly, they could be an actual solution to reach food security.', 'The epigenetic\\nThe epigenetic, it\\'s a modification of the expression to DNA, without genetic modification. It\\'s a domain of study near to the genetic but it\\'s very recente. The epigenetic gives  much informations. The epigenetic can be use in differents domains like the health, the research and other. It explains many things like the cat color \"calicot\" which is a modification epigenetic in the DNA of the female cat. For example, epigenetic is observed on the mouse, which are differents because the food eat by the mother. The epigenetic can have different form. In first the condensation of the chromatine which can silenced or activated differents genes. The histones can be modified by methylation, ubiquitination and other.\\nIt existes many methodes in epigenetic like the Chip, which is a immunoprecipitation.\\n For me this discover is really important because this allows to know more mecanism genetic, like the plant vernalization and the devernalization. It can be use in agronomy, genetic, medical research and many others fields. The plants use the epigenetic to resist against the global warming. It can modify the response to  some stresses, like drought stress, heat stress, light stress... The vernalization needs epigenetics modifications with methylation of the histone H3K27, which silence FLC gene and H3K4, which active the same gene. H3K27me3 silences the FLC which silence an important gene for the flowering , FT. The vernalization depend to the cold and the heat. The methylation depend to these stresses.', 'My scientific experience that I did was a master 2 internship at the Healthy Plant Protection Laboratory in Paris.\\nIt was a good experience when I worked in pairs on a subject that is very interesting, I worked on a sickness and we who reported for the first time to the region of oust of Paris.\\nit is a work on citrus for anthracnose disease that affects this sector and is a major cause of damage that affects later the yield and quality.\\nour job is to study the disease in général and proposed solutions is to fight against this\\n My internship allowed me to  have the chance to manipulate them, to learn new techniques and methods whatever in the laboratory or in the field and my ability to work with professionals who helped me and directed me during the internship period ,all this allowed me to  welcome more knowledges.\\nthis experience too allowed me to learn more in my scientific domain and in my daily life', \"I did an internship at Carlsberg Laboritory Research in Paris. My subject was on the dry hopping and  hop breeding. Hops are an aromatic plant and it use on the beer to develop bitterness or to deliver aromatic oil to the beer. Normally, during the beer process, hops is add at the end of boiling step (15 minutes before the end). This method develop a bitter aroma because at this temperature all aromatic oils contains on hops is evaporate.\\nNow, the dry hopping consist to add hop pellets during the fermentation step. The temperature is around 15°C and aromatic oils stay on the beer. With this technique, we could create a lot of different taste. There is a lot of hops varietes with unique character.\\nThe interresting part of this project was to test different hops with different yeast. The fermentation step need yeast who will eat sugar in the beer and producing alcohol. With the dry hopping, we add hop at the same time. During this experimentation, the development of flavor and aroma due to aromatic oil contains in hop pellets was totally different with the different yeast.\\n Thanks to this experiment, the best yeast was identifie, the yeast who develop a stronger and good aroma. Because certain yeast develop a bad flavour and taste. Add hops pellets during the fermentation step with yeast permise to develop more aromatic oil contain on hops pellets. This results is really interresting, that means we could use less hops pellets and have the same aromatics oils quantites on the beer, the same flavour and aroma. The price of hops pellets is really expensive (40 euro for 100g and we need 1 g for 1L of beer) so it's a possibility to decrease the price of the production.\\nAnother good point of this experimentation is the huge possibility to create new flavour and new aroma on the beer. There is a lot of hops varietes and a lot of yeast, we could test a lot of combinaison and discover new flavor. Hops is really an interresting climbing plant and I think it's the future of beer development.\", \"This year, we must realised a project in agronomy on the bean in order to derminate ascochyta's impact on this plants. We must calculated the leaf area before and after instalation of the desease. We have calculated the agressevity and incidence of this desease to have informations on its propagation in th agricultural system. That's why, we have done the mesures in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, we have inoculated our bean plants to calculated leaf area, the lenght of the leaves. Moreover, we have realised a dissection of the apex in order to see the leaves numbers and to see the progression of this desease. Indeed, Ascochyta make necrosis on the leaf. So, the development of our plants can be affected and to stop. We have studied the seed of the CIPAN for evaluate its effects on the bean plants beacause this seed was present in the last year on the field.\\n In this study, we have proposed a perfect protocol who we have permit to say what ascochyta could reduce the leaf area and the numbers of the leaves on the bean plants. We have see what ascochyta have been very fast, it has destroyed our plants in few days. On the field, the bean plants was attacked by bioagressor and our experiences have been really bad.

Why have we a sediment on the nail ? Because the potentiel electric of the couple Cu2+ / Cu is higher than the potentiel electric of the couple Fe2+ /Fe. In chemistry the potentiel electric allows us to preview an reaction before really doing it. In chemistry this couple of iron and copper are couple redox so a oxidant react with a reducer in exchange of electron. In the solution Cu2+  give an electron to Fe and this reaction given copper and Fe2+ in an exchange of electron.\\n This experitment wich allows to see if there are copper in a solution or not can be useful in the chemistry industry to see if there are copper on a machine or in the water or any solution which can be contaminated by any form of copper. Copper which can be dangerous in many experitment or for human and animals life. This experitment is convenient, and can be realise with not much materials in disposition, it is not hard to make this result so  much doing this experitment than another one for the same result.', \"Today, I talk about an scientific experiment, when in class we have make our Aspirin®.

It is an experience that we realize during a practical work in inorganic chemistry.\\nFirst, we made react different compounds between them to observe the rendering, to know what color gave this mixture, if we obtained a precipitate. Moreover, these manipulations allowed us to know how to eliminate a compound from a solution. It is necessary to be careful during these experiments because the accidents can arrive very quickly, it is necessary to take precautions, like for example to hold the test tube, in which one makes the mixture of compounds, with a pincer.\\nAfter that, we had a solution and we needed to know what that solution was, based on the results of previous experiences. This part is more complicated to realized.\\nAnd finally, we can estimate the concentration of each compound in this solution.\\n For this experience you need to have a lot of knowledge, to know what gives two solutions that react between them.\\nThese experiences give me a taste of the style of job that I could practice later. This experience is rewarding.', \"GPS is a best technology in the world .

This test is easy to realise whith the necessary equipement.\\n    At the first step, we must to do a metals mixture. The colour is done by the using metals. For example if we use niquel, the glass is going to be yellow or if we use copper, is going to be blue. We mix this metal with another whit metal who is abble to react with the colour metal at high temperatures. So this glass is comestible beacuse this metals are meltings whith humidity\\n    Secondly, we put the metals mixture in a oven at 900°C so that te metals can be react. When is it molten, we put out the mixture, we put the liquid on a brass spuport, beacause the fusion temperature of the brass is very high. And we crush the liquid with brass piece. We must to make that very quicly because if the liquid mixture is not crush whith brass quicly, the liquid cristalise. We can not have glass if the liquid cristalise.\\n   To finish, we must to look if the glass is well done and not cristalise. So that, we use a rayon X diffraction. If the glass is well done, when we pass an echantillon in the RX, we must observe pics on the diagram. In effect, the glass is well stucture so the RX can traverse and create pic. If the glass is not well done and we create cristal, the RX diagram do not present pic. The cristal is not well structure so RX can not pass in the cristal and do not provoc pics.\\n    So, we can create comestible and colour glass whith only two mtals and a very powerfull oven.\\n not time', 'The phone is essential for to live and he is evolved since that he invented.

My partner and I were watching out and paying attention to all the rocks around us. When there is a « in place » serie, we had to take a « pendage » which means the angle of where the serie is directed compared the geographical north pole.

It deals with photoelectronical effect, which verified the law and the quantification of radiation.\\nWe determined the sensitivity of a cell depending on differents waves lenght. The curve of the experience shows a straight line so we deduced that the sensitivity of the cell is proportional to the wave lenght. But the problem is that the efficiency is not so high. We remade this experiment with a fixed wave but differents voltages. We notice that we had now a straight line too but it is inversely proportional.\\nThose results permit us to conclude that the number of electrons emitted by cathode is proportional to the light flow. And the kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the light flow. It depends only on exciting radiation's frequency.\\n The efficiency is too low to be used but it is just for this material. The maximal efficiency we have is around 40% to 50% which is not enough. So we have to continue our seek on this topic until we find a performance around 80%.\", 'We all know that the ocean is something which facinate everbody because of his importance in the Hearth and also by his secret.

It consist of putting together salisylic acid and acetic anhydrid in a balloon and we heat it to around sixty degrees in a water bath during 30 minutes. Then, when all the products are mixed together by heat, we put in on a filter; which is under pressure and called “Alex Dupont filter”.\\n  Then, we made two different products: the acetylsalisylic acid (or aspirin) and acetic acid (which gives it smell to vinegar). Our next step is to separate these two products to purify then later. The thing that simplify this step is that the acetic acid can be solved in water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.\\n  After the separation step, we purify the aspirin by warm it again with a mix of ethanol and water. The mix will extract from the aspirin the traces of water and products from the beginning, which doesn’t react. When the asprin and the solvent are mixed together we stop heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to be in a stable state. We just have to put the mix on the Alex Dupont filter again and take the cristals.\\n  In conclusion, by few steps of heating, filtring and purification, we succefully made aspirin which can be used in pharmacy.\\n These kind of experience are very interesting because it helps to understand how what we learnt in theoric classes can be used to make interessant things. Specially for medical things because it helps people to get better.\\nBut few things that we learnt in classes, for example reaction with petrol, are made for industrial things that are not in adequation with my ethics (preserve the environment, to not be depedent of precise product). Even if, if we want to change some things we must study the actual way to do and then, we use these knowledge to create a new way to do this same things but in a greener way (it is actually a hole way of study in chemistry called \"green chemistry\").\\nSo if I want to explain shortly what I think about the consequences of what we mae in chemistry, I will say that the actual way to do things are not perfect but we have to learn all the things about our way to do to create a new way to do.', 'During this year’s first semester, me and a classmate chose a topic related to  materials’ evolution through the ages, for a project on one of our Engineering classes.\\n Since the early 1900s, men were driven by the idea of being able to fly, and since then, the design and the mechanics of airplanes has changed and evolved exponentially.\\n The very first airplanes that were designed were inspired from the famous “First Flight” prototype built by the Wright Brothers, Kitty Hawk, the first powered aircraft. These planes were all made of wood, because of his incredible resistance and thickness; although through the years the goal set by aeronautical engineers, was to improve the capacities of the aircraft, reduce fuel consomption and more importantly, reduce the weight of the aircraft.\\n Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.\\n Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.\\n Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.\\n This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.\\nThis project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world. Because one of the many qualities that an engineer mind must have, is to be able to think outside of the box and to have a large imagination, cause these kinds of ideas are the ones that at first are thought of as impossible or even laughed at; but in the end they are the solution to a better world.\\nJust look at Alex Dupont for example, he went from ending up in debts because of his \"meaningless\" investments, to being one of the most recognized brilliant minds of our time.', 'The Aspirin synthesis\\n   The aspirin is a medicine and its synthesis is important for the pharmaceutic industry.\\n   The mechanism of this synthesis is quite simple but it require heat and light.\\n The first step is to create a phenol with as reactive a benzene. The phenol is a benzene who has an alcohol function on one of its carbon. This reaction is hard so we need to synthesis the cumene first and then we had the phenol. The step two is an aromatic electrophil substitution between the phenol and a dibrom. Then we use magnesium, carbon dioxide and water and the product of these multiple addition is a benzene who had an alcohol function and a carboxylic acid function on two of its carbon.  This reaction take place in an acid space.\\n With these steps we have synthesized the salicylic acid.\\n   The last step of this synthesis is the reaction between the salicylic acid and an ester (the acetic anhydride). For this reaction, we put both of the reactive in a balloon and we heat the balloon at the temperature of 55 °C. When we heated the solution, there is a gaze formation and we used a reflux heater for transform the vapor in liquid. Then we put the balloon on the ice and we filter the product.\\n The last manoeuvre is purification and for that we put with the product ethanol and water. After we heat again and we filter the melange. The final product is a white powder who is called aspirin.\\n   The aspirin is used in our everyday life’s. You can take it when you had a headache or a stomachache or when you are in physical pain and you need to feel a little better.\\n This medicine is an inhibitor molecule and its replace the nor-adrenaline in the synapse. Like that you don’t feel the pain linked to your sickness. You are pain free for couple hour.\\n For this synthesis we used some toxic chemical as acid and we put lots of not neccessary product in the bin.\\nThe master problem of the chemical industry is that it used lots of water and had lots of waste.\\nIt had both a good and bad side. The chemical industry is a source of scientific discoveries but it is the source of pollution too.\\nAs everything in this world, this synthesis is both a blessing and a curse.', \"Science is fun , thaht why for this subject I chose a chimie's expérience : make In/visibles Ink\\n To product it we need Vinegar, Hot wate, Blues Ink and Sodium bicarbonate ; we use hot Water like solution and the rest like soluté .\\n To realize this expérience, we start by to heat the water to 100°C, the hot water is use like solution.\\n Then ,we pouring blues's ink in small container .\\n After that, Dilute the ink of the container with the boiling water, and add the acid solution (vinegar) and some bicarbonate.\\n To finish , Add vinegar to the prepared solution.\\nNB : So add vinegar make visible ink and and bicarbonate make invisible.\\n To start, This expérience is fun and eaze to realize so I think it's a good first expérience to make science interesting to young people.\\nIn fact we see a acide réaction , Dilute ink  , notion of solution and soluté.\\nTo finish the teacher can add value to all reagent to add notions of formulate (acide raction), so this experience can easily be adapted studiens levels\", 'Let me whrite about an experiment which was realized years ago. This experiment is about the duality of the light which can act like a particle or a wave. Until the discovery of this duality, people did not understand the way light behaved. This experiment and the results the scientist observed made possible the comprehension of some phenomenon related to the light.\\n First, we can talk about the experiment which was made. This experiment some scientist realized was Alex Dupont’s. It was a really simple experiment because they just made light going through two little gap and they observed that the light did not behave as expected. Also, the two gap were separated by a larger space (if they had not, the experiment would not had worked). Besides, the two gap needed to be really tiny to not let pass to much light or it would not had been possible to observed anything. Scientist discovering that light could comport as waves or particles was a really big step ahead to understand a lot of observations made in the past which were impossible to even believe because light has in the same time properties of waves and particles.\\n After they made this experiment, they observed a spectrum designed on the screen behind which one was created by interferences. Some of these interferences were called constructive and others, on the opposite, destructive because the first one permitted to see the light on the screen when the second kind of interferences let a black screen. These interferences are observed because of the difference of vibration between two « wave » of light when it goes through the different gap because after, there are two part of light which can interfere.\\n In conclusion, we can say that there are no direct applications of this discovery but it permitted to understand better the way that light was acting and also a lot of phenomenon which are linked to the way that light behave.\\nIn my opinion, there are no direct applications of the discovery of the wave-particle duality but, it permitted understand how light was acting and, this can be used to define and explain a lot of things which can be useful and used in every day life. Maybe it is not the most useful discovery human made but, it is one of the most important anyway. Besides, that is possible that in the future, this discovery will be used to make something useful for every day life.\\nWe made this experiment in class, Alex Dupont’s, to see the same phenomenon scientist observed and then, we talked about the different kind of interferences. I do not think it was very useful to make this experiment except to see what scientist did in the past and why, in the first place, they did not understand what they observed because they did not know about this duality. But, because there are no direct applications of this discovery, we did not see anything about what we could do with this so, I think that is why I do not believe that, for now, it is really useful.', 'I will write about an fabulous instruments use in many experience and in many domain from medical to the defence, the L.A.S.E.R.\\n \\tA L.A.S.E.R is a acronyme for « Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ».

That is why, industry of boats has increased a lot these last decades. Many engineers work in order to improve the performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the steel. So, the question is: How this anode does it work?\\n \\tFirst of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused by the difference between the O2’s potential and Fe’s one. In that way, we have: Fe → Fe2+ + e-  and O2 + H+ + 4e- → 2H2O.\\n Steel is not still steel. It becomes ions. With O2, it is transformed in Fe(OH)2, a red oxide.\\n \\tThen, the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-. They increase conduction and the share of electrons. Therefor, oxidation of Fe becomes more important.\\n So, it was necessary to find a way to reduce or stop this corrosion.\\n \\tWe have seen that scientists invented the anode made of zinc. How does it protect our steel?\\n Zinc (Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative potential. Therefore, O2 reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are protected and safe!\\n \\tTo conclude, steel is protected thanks to zinc because of their difference of electric potentials. On order to avoid corrosion, a piece of zinc is melted on the steel.\\nAccording to me, the invention of the sacrificed anode had a huge impact on the maritime market. Their life-during increased, their maintenance price decreased. It favours globalization.\\n Nevertheless, with some accidents, such has recently the “crash” of America Grande rised the question: Is it really good to let these boats navigate during three of four decades?', 'Some animals have special abilities to survive in hard conditions. Scientists can run animal tests to exploit this capacities and maybe one day apply it to humans. Animal experimentation isn’t a new thing, in fact, to scientists have to run trials to commercialise a drug or a cosmetic supplies.\\nFor medicinal drugs there are really strict laws to commercialise a drug. Industries have to follow many steps to make a safe and efficient antidots. For this they have to run tests on humans but before that they have to do it on animal. For this, they have various animal that are born just for testing, like rats, rabbits or even monkeys. Labs have to do like inhalations, skin contact, injections or ingestions on a long period to be sure that the drug is safe.\\nSome cosmetic industries do run animal testing but it is not an obligation. For exemple if a company wants to commercialise a cosmetic product in Paris which is a huge country and so a strategic country they are obligated to run trials on animal to commercialise their brand there.\\nBut some brands have a special label that say that they do not test on animal, they are cruelty free.\\nSome animal like naked mole rats or axolots are stategic animal for the futur. The naked mole rat have the abilitie to survive his whole life without developping cancers or disies. They also do not feel pain, some scientis have put acids on them and this animal did not feel anything.\\nAxolots have the ability to regenerat their body parts, like legs or even brain parts. So some scientist do cut intentionaly this little animals body part.\\nNowaday animal expérimentation is essential to cure ourselfs when we get sike, but is it essential to do it for cosmetic products?\\n I think that animal testing is not essential, because this little things a breed only to run trials on them.\\nSome companies claim that they are not testing on animal and now a day people are oppening their eyes and prefer to use non tested products.', 'NOTECHNOLOGIES\\n Let’s talk about nanotechnologies\\n Nanotechnologies could be define as the whole studies, manipulations of structures and proceeds of fabrication of systems at nanometric scale. The first time that someone talked about nanotechnologies was in 1959 when Alex Dupont says there was a new way of research at a very small scale.\\n  Nanotechnologies can be applied in many field like biosciences,medical,army...\\n Nowadays,  nanotechnologies are everywhere, in fact we can use it to make our glasses waterproof, materials for computers, materials with specials properties.\\n Nanotechnologies can already be used in the medical field.\\n In a near futur, nanotechnologies will probably allow us to cure many deseases such as cancer. In fact we will send nano-robots in our bodies to eliminate with precision the tumors. Moreover, nanotechnologies will be used in the military field to make nanodrones or even super resistant exosquelettons. Those exosquelettons could resist to a nuclear bomb.\\n Nevertheless, to use nanotechnologies we will have to reduce it environmental footprint because the production of nanotechnologies produce a lot of wastes. Furthermore, the pesticids used in agriculture polute the surounding fields and rivers. Nanotechnologies\\n I think it can be usefull but we have to master it.', 'Let’s talk about chemistry history.\\n By the end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements), distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”, “earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass from one to the other, unless we used what people called a Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a legend. Step by step, as scientists made experiments, alchemistry slowly turned into what we now know as chemistry.\\n One of the most famous experience that made alchemistry turn into chemistry is the experience of the grown tree. A Dutch scientist had the idea of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the first step to discover Photosynthesis.\\n History is interesting, and discovering never stops.', 'Solar Impulse : tomorrow’s challenge\\n  During these last few years environment has taken a bigger place in our lives and this is one of the main challenge the world has to face in the future. In the same time the growth of the world’s population and  the travelling people around the world, push developers to explore different kinds of transports. How can we combine these two areas ? The Solar Impulse is one first step in what we can do with environment and transport.\\n  First of all, the first prototype of Solar Impulse was released in 2009. The main goal for its creators was to built a plane entirely autonomous in energy. The pane does not need any fossil fuel to fly, but only the energy offered by the sun. To convert this solar energy (radiation) into electricity, the wing’s plane are recovered by solar panels made of silicon. These wings are made of different layers. The photons presents in the sun radiation interacts with the electrons presents in the layers. Thanks to an intern process electricity is created. Finally, create electricity is not that hard ; but to being able to fly a long distance, the plane needs to create electricity in mass.\\n  In addition of producing electricity the plane has got an other challenge to face : autonomy which is directly linked to safety ; of course we do not want the plane to be forced to land in the ocean or in the Paris as the captain Alex Dupont did in 2009. At the beginning, the Solar Impulse could made only short travels and mostly during the day when there is more sun. It is true that they had to find a solution to being able to fly during the night when there is no sun at all. After few tries they decided to add big batteries (four) on the wings to stock the energy produced during the day but not used. That way they achieved their first world’s tour in July 2016. Finding a plane able to travel all around the world in an ecological way is  a real breakthrough. The next step today will be to built a Solar Impulse for commercial flight.\\n  Last but not least, the challenge of tomorrow is to create a plane on the Solar impulse’s model to transport passengers from a town to another, with a not to high cost.\\n  The problem today is that commercial planes are bigger and bigger and the rapport of their weigh and their surface is to short. In fact, if we want to transport as many people as in actual commercial flight, the future solar plane will need a huge surface to welcome a lot of solar panels. Of course such a weigh (plane and passengers) needs a big quantity of energy. Today all these challenges are not compatible and developers need to find THE idea which can change the future. As an aeronautic fan, I am looking forward for that day. It would be a date to remember for sure.\\n It was enriching fro our skills.', 'Quantification of energy has always been a key idea in physics and is now teach practical classes of physics. An experiment to understood this abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle.\\n The purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.\\n First to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able to approach this number and continue the experiment.\\n In a second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the final wave length.\\n Moreover other formulas of physics help us is our research of the values of energy as well as Energy=(Plank constant*speed of light)/wave length. The energy here is the variation between the initial and the final state and using mathematical deductions we found the values of energy for each state of quantum number for the hydrogen atom.\\n This was a very interesting experiment to work on.', 'The discovery of the wheel\\n The wheel has traveled the world throught all the century and the time. We don’t know all the exact date of this discover because this invention is very old. However, different traces like research in archeology have permitted us to date the first presence of the wheel in the humanity. Indeed in 1974 in Paris, one of the oldest trace of wheel has been discover and we estimate his age at about -3500 years before JC. It was used at the beggining just as trolley, but it’s amazing how in short time it evolved. In some centuries, human reach to create wood wheel and wooden vehicle.  After that we saw just a little evolution of this objet. But many of application have been found and very usefull to all human’s field, like science, mechanics… Today we still use it, and try to optimise it, for example in order to minimize the waste of energy.\\n Time', \"Starlite\\n \\tLet me talk about starlite. Starlite is a new material invented in the 80’s by a english chemist. Starlite's composition is a closely guarded secret, but it is said to contain a variety of organic polymers  looks like paint. Thanks to his properties, many international organisations wanted to test it and make profit of it, for exemple the english ministery of defence, NATO... This material seems like a mix of metal and ceramic. When starlite is warmed, a coat of carbon is created to protect the material.\\n \\tIts properties make it interesting and scientists afirm it’s incredible. Starlite has a high-temperature resistance and it can be warmed at 10 000 degrees celsium. The most famous experiment has been done in the 80’s. A scientist put starlite on a egg and he started to warm it. Starlite protected the egg and when scientist opened it, it was liquid.\\n Today, we are not sure of the potentials uses of starlite but it could be useful in army.\\n In my opinion, starlite could improve ourlife if we had fields of application.\", \"In medical school they want to replace dead body by a virtual tablette for anatomy\\n I think it's a very good thing\", 'As Alex Dupont said : \"Nothing is without poison, what makes poison is the dose\".\\n From my point of view, people who use products or substances to stay active like coffee should not abuse of it. In the normal dose coffee is effective on the brain but if we abuse of it, it could bring an increase of cholesterol rate wich can cause a myocardial infarction for example. However, I think that this sentence is true for substances in everydaylife like coffee or food supplements but with parmacological products we have to be more attentive.', 'Scientific researchers have created a tool that improves sportive performances. It consists on electrical discharges focused on the motor cortex of the brain. Sportsean use it before their training in order to stay efficient longer and to recover better.\\nResearchers have noticed that the fatigue felt after a physical exercice was due to the exhaustation of the brain, more than the muscular tiredness.  Therefore, stimulating the motor cortex enables to last longer in a race for instance, without feeling any pain for a longer time.\\n Researchers have noticed the efficiency of the technic. They organized experimentations: they measured the muscular strenght before and after a specific time of running. When they added the electric discharge at the beginning of the race, the sportmen had almost the same strenght before and after running. Without the stimulation of the cortex motor, the musuclar strenght was totally down after physical pratise.\\nVarious people in different sports, have decided to give a try to this new technology in order to enhance their performances and to improve their results.\\nYet, it actually brings with it the issue of doping: for the moment the international group against doping has confirmed it currently does not enter in the definition of doping since it is not specific substance introduce in the body.\\nYet, we may wonder whether It will not be issue is some years when this technic will have spread over the sport community. I seems to give a huge advantage for its users and could reveal ethical questions.', \"A 3D bioprinter can be used to repare skin damage for patients with large burn. It scan the wound and create a piece of skin for transplant. It has been produced by reaserches from Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medecine in Paris, Paris.

The device scan the wound and know exactly where to put the cells. The technologie need to be tested on human being. It can avoid painfull graft.\\nFor patients with large skin damages, it would be faster to heal and painless because we don't have to remove skin from the patient and make it growth before transplant it.\", 'Nowadays, we talk more and more about bioartificial pancreas, it is a new technology that has been made to remplace deficients pancreas and to heal patients that suffers from diabete.

Because it's not a very efficient experience, and this need to have more researches about this subject. That's why we can developpe this discovery to have more hindsight of this new project. In Paris some researcher have decided to treat about this innovation to improve medicine : to help surgeon for difficult surgery.\", \"The Artificial Intelligence (AI) improves the diagnosis of cancers and the medicine has understood it, in the image of the Parisian Hospital of Pitier-Salpêtrière, which quickly adopted iBiopsy.\\nThis artificial intelligence platform revolutionizes the treatment of pathologies, including liver cancer.

X-Rays were accidentally discovered when a German physicist Alex Dupont was studying the process of electric current passing through a gas of extremely low pressure. He observed that in a darkened room, the cathode ray tube covered with barium platinocyanide caused a fluorescent effect. Since the cathode rays are invisible, he didn’t know what the rays were and named it X-radiation for its unknown nature. He won the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery. The initial reception to the discovery, however, was met with hostility and mockery with a New York Times journalist referring to it as \"an alleged discovery of a method to photograph the invisible\".\\n On my point of view, X-ray imaging are an amazing invention but when it was invented, the scientists did not know the adverse effects of the X-Ray.\\nBut there is a lot of adverse effects of this type of medecine because of there ray are nuclear radiation. So, as they did not know this, they made a lot of X-ray exams and a lot of patient developped a cancer and chronical diseases.\\nTo conclude, X-Ray imaging developped a lots the medical knowledge and help the physician to made a diagnosis on many diseases but with have to use it carefully to to avoid the misuse.', 'the invention of the stetoscope :\\n\\n\\nBefore the stetoscope was invented,  doctors would listen to their patient’s heartbeats by putting their ear to their chests.  For instance, if there was considerable insulation between the actual heart and exterior of his chest in the form of fat, this method failed.  Exactly, one such situation was faced by French physician Alex Dupont, when he couldn’t judge the heart rate of one of his patients on account of too much fat on him. He invented the stethoscope as a wooden trumpet-shaped tube that amplified sounds coming from lungs and heart. That principle of sound amplification hasn’t yet changed till date.\\n In my opinion, I think that the stetoscope has reinvented the medecine and in particular the clinical examination. It permits to change radicaly the heart and the pulmonary examination because just with the nose of the organs, now you can tell which disease you suffer from. Whitout any complementary exams, you can know lots of things about your body. This is a quickly clinical exam.', \"They want to replace dead bodies by an virtual tablet for anatomy.

Later they discovered opiates and used it to reduce the pain. The cocaïne was the first effective local anesthetic, but doctors thought it was safe for patients and a lot of people became addict to it.\\nThe ether appeared in the 19th century in Paris, when a lot of people thought that surgery can't exist without pain. After that some men found the chloroform and the curare to inhibit the muscle contraction.

Develop by two young Californians engineers, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, the program is a list of questions who check the probabilites of a disease. For example, if a doctor have a patient with a dyspnea, the doctor can check the case of the dyspnea and the computer displays the probabilities of a cardiological problem and a pulmonary problem ! This invention permits to all people in medecine to hope a future with less errors of diagnosis, and a semiological learning simplify by this help. If some people was scared by this intrusion of informatical domain in medecine, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont are cleared : the program doesn't replace humans ! It's just an helper program, who absolutely need humans to being good.\\n I think it's a huge progress for the medicine : this program permits to us to have less pressure with a patient, permits also to us to be alleviate during the semiological learning ; medecine is a huge knowledge, and I think if we permits to doctors to have a less-pressure learning, it can be benefit for their practise. This innovation allows also medicine to open window on the future : if we include informatical program in our practise, we can share lot of information between us, increase our mutual experience who prepare us to more different cases of diseases. So, I think everyone is winner with this type of progress : patients, who are being more successful treat, or doctors, who can do more correcty their job !\", \"I am going to talk about test tube baby. Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.\\nFor the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start.\\nIt takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Alex Dupont. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health.\\nBut to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes.\\n But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population.\\nSome people think it is a good thing to help these people. They consider sterile people as sick people who need to be cured.\\nBut others do not have the same advice. For them, things that we can do do not mean that we have to do them. And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him?\\nWe are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession?\\nGiving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.\", \"Originally, smart pills are used for people who suffer from narcolepsy or hyperactivity.\\nFirst of all, it can help them to stay focused. It can also improve their short time memory and decrease their anxiety. Thus, this is one of the most prescripted medications for those pathologies.\\nHowever, nowadays, more and more students use them to enhance their mental capacities, and also to help them managing their stress.\\n In my opinion, smart pills are very dangerous.\\nFirst of all, there is no scientific evidence about the efficiency of smart drugs on healthy people. Indeed, there is a huge gap between an actual scientific study and what is stated by the media.\\nAmongst the many side effects which have been reported we can find insomnia, depression, hallucinations and a decreased appetite. It is actually quite paradoxiacal: the students' purpose is to enhance their mental capacities, in order to be more performant, but in the end, smart pills can lead to a nervous break down.  Thus, is seems more damaging than helpful.\\nIf smart pills are subject to medical prescription today, it means that a medical follow up is necessary, for example to find the appropriate dose. This cannot be the case for all students.\\nWe should also be concerned about the addiction issue. Indeed, just like with all other drugs, there is an important risk to become addicted. Students start with a few pills during revision periods, and in the end, they find themselves unable to work without those pills.\\nLast but not least, the cost is a major concern. You have to pay between $2 and $5 for a single pill, which is dreadfully expensive for students, for whom finantial problems already represent a big issue.\", \"More than 15 % of Oxford University students' use smart pills without prescprition. You might thus ask yourself why they are used and what their risks can be?\\nTo begin with, students use those drugs to boost their mental capacities and stay awake for longer. These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia. They are proven to work on these sock patients by making narcoleptic pateints saty awake for longer for example. However, no study has shown that they could boost healthy people's energy. It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance.\\nSecondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health.\\n I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause. Moreover, its is not even proven that they help with studying for exams, which is why they are taken by studnets. they cause more harm than good. Not only are they dangerous for your health but also for your safety. since those drugs ae bought illegaly, you could get some problems with the police. You can get up to 5 years of jail in the Paris. Finally, I am against those smart pills beacuse they create inequlities amongst students. Brain enhancers are quite expensive, not all students can buy them. The main problem is that people that would not normally take those pills are gonna feel like they need to take them to stay competitive since many other people are taking them. Therefore smart pills are dangerous, create inequalities and people feel the need to take them because of others taking them to stay competitive.\", \"THE DISCOVERY OF THE PLASTIC SURGERY\\n       For a long time, there was no issues for people who were ugly. They had to leave with their complex during all their life. There were also people who had an accident and they couldn't do anything because they were disfigured and they had to live with that.\\n       Plastic surgery has been an exceptional discovery for these people because they found a solution to their problems. Let me give you an example : Alex Dupont. He was an afro american star and he didn't like his skin colour, and he also had a disease, the vitiligo which consists in a skin depigmentation so he decided to do plastic surgery and he became white. Plastic surgery changed his life for the best (for himself) but some detractors will say that he was ugly as a white peson.\\n      Plastic urgery is also a solution for serious burned people. It can be people who tried to immolate themself or also people who had and accident like a car crash who stayed in a fire for a while. We can practice plastic surgery on them to reimplant tissues, to give them a new skin, and forth and so on...\\n       There are also people that use it to remplace a part of their body because they find it ugly like their nose, their breast. It's a really expensive surgery but people don't care about the price. More and more people want to do plastic surgery, specially young adult. Everybody wants to become really beautiful htat's why they will pay to have a better nose, a better chin.\\n               That's why plastic surgery is a extraordinary discovery because it helps many kinds of people. From sick people to rich people who wants to become handsome.\\n Plastic surgery is a really interesting speciality if it is used to help people in a death danger (like people who had an accident). However, it has some defaults. It can be used by the wrong people, and it can be too much used by very rich people. I think the government has to pute some regulations on the plastic surgery, in order to be not missused by the wrong persons.\", \"Teh Nobel of 2018 was about immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is already known and used in medecine but they discovered a new method to create antibody.\\nImmunotherapy is based on the princip that we can create in vitro antibody to implat them on a patient to cure him. An antibody is a protein made physiologicaly by the body to defend himself against virus and bacteries. Its a protein with 4 part : 2 heavy-chains and 2 light-chains in a strucure in Y. There is a constant part and 2 variables parts. The constant part can be reconized by the immunity cells, and the variable part is specific to an unique antigen (a molecule specific of what isn't physiologicaly in our body). So in a way, it's coud be possible to create antibody against almost every thing : for example, it would be possible to use an antibody against the the oestrogen receptor on mammary cells, receptor which is overexpressed in the mammary cancer.\\nTo create an antibody, there is different possibilities but the more efficient is to to take a B-lymphocyte (the cells whose secrets anti body) from a healthy people, then to activate him with the molecule we want him to create antibody against, and to modify his DNA to make it cancerous and to implant it in a mouse, and so he will multiply and we would be able to take plenty of anti body in the mouse's blood.\\n I think immunotherapy is a fabulous way to cure people, and offer plenty of opportunities with incurable disease. However, we need to take care about the power it gives and we need to stay focus on the good way to use it. Moreover, we need to take a look at the mousetreatment which is not so good with a cancer.\", \"Alzheimer is a disease touching millions of citizisen around the world. It affects the brain cells which degenerated, causing a slow loss of memory.  Lots of research are undertaked around the world, and at the moment, there are no healing treatment, they try to slow down the degenerescence but they can not stop it, but there is hope.\\nThe discovery of the probable mecanism of the disease : an accumalation of protein in the synapse of the cells, the tau protein and in the environment of the cells, there is the formation of amyloid plaques.\\nThere is different prospects of treatment :\\n- Immunotherapy : Antibody of the the protein Tau and of the Beta amyloid which could stop the development of these plaque, and the degenerescence. This procedure is at a high rank of hope : the trials are going good. These treatment needs to be applicated in the begining of the disease, because it stops the propagation but, it is not restoring the lost cells.\\n-A Vaccine : kind of the same principe of the immunotherapy, with antibody against myeloid plaque, but there is a lot of side effetcs.\\n It is really interesting to see all the mobilization of the research : scientist but also society (lots of donation), there is a lot of hope, and me, the first one, I feel really confident about the future of this disease, which at this moment is still unhealable.\\nA vaccine could be a fabulous way of prevention of these disease if it could be find, because people could be vaccine, and would never contract the disease that we can't threat..\\nFor the immunotherapy, the patient needs to be take over fast and the disease needs to be diagnostic quickly since there is no recovery possible of the loss cell. SO this could be a good way, if the disease is already here, but it could be a brake because of the time of diagnosis..\", 'Genetics manipulations had been discover recently. Scientist use it in purpose to modify organism and create GMO. Those manipulations consist on DNA’s modification.\\n            First, they have to control gene’s expression. They rather can overexpress gene or underexpress it. Enzyme are use to cut the dna sequence and micro-organism can be use as a vector to insert new dna fragment. When new fragment dna are insert inside a gene, new protein or inhibition of the gene expression can result.\\n            Changement in DNA’s sequence lead to various modification such cell work and function. This technology have been use for years now most of the time for alimentation and industry. Thanks to genetic manipulation, compagny can improve their food quality. They also work on many different aspect such as health resistance. Nowaday, big farm use those manipulation to create one year only plants. In that way, farmers have to buy new plants every year\\nIn my opinion genetics manipulation are good. Despite, it has to be control so people with negatif intention can not do whatever they want. I think it’s a big discovery for the food gap world go throw nowaday. It’s harder to juged when it’s about modify baby in purpose to create the « perfect one ». Even if genetics manipulation are a good thing, they have to be control and restricted to plants. This technology could be a major help to fight against hunger in the world as well as against climate changements.', \"Recently, the research against cancer has found new molecules that could have an effect on cancer cells. In fact, it is a kind of vaccines which is able to stimulate the immune system of patients affected by a cancer. Studies have been done in laboratories on animals and are beginning on hundreds of women and men. These molecules aren't on the market yet but scientists hope that they will be in less than 10 years. The aim of this new vaccine is to inject deux molecules : a CpG oligonucleotide and the receptor OX40. Thanks to that injection, T cells of the patient can be activated and destruct the cancer cells.\\n Even if this vaccine is not available yet, we can hope that he we permit to save many lives. It is important to know that cancer is the disease which kills the most in many countries of the world. The main reason for this is that no treatment has been developped. A woman have recently been cured from a breast cancer thanks to this technique so this is very auspicious.\\nMoreover, I think that it is important to remember that the research against tha cancer can be financed by donations. If everybody mobilize and participates to help the research against cancer, we will find a solution quicker to this sad disease.\", 'I am very concerned about health of other people and i have always thought that if i can do something to help people, i would done it. Since when i am 18 years old, i have decided to make four times a year a blood donation. Indeed, hospitals are always in need and patients are dependant of it. For us it\\'s just a question of time whereas for this people, it\\'s a question of life and death.\\nSo far, i\\'ve done many of blood donation but  one year ago, I heard about an other important gesture we can simply make as volunteer : a bone marrow donation. It\\'s scared me first beause this isn\\'t a issue of needle in our arm now, it\\'s more about a needle in your back and this is quite frightening. Furthermore, we can be call at moment for this donation and we have to be available to travel around the country (sometimes in europe) to make this donation. Then, I discovered that I wasn\\'t well informed and I have decided to register. First, the donation don\\'t have to be with a needle in your back anymore. The most of the time, they inject you  something that is making bone marrow cells appears in your blood, then they collect them with a blood sample (Sometimes it\\'s not because of the patient condition, or your condition too). So it didn\\'t appeared scary to me anymore. Then, I discovered that Paris doesn\\'t have enough donor (I think 200,000), but compatibility is 1 over 1,000,000 so we don\\'t have enough donor for the number of patient. This way, french hospitals have to ask to other countries as Paris (with more than 4,000,000 donors if there is a match. I don\\'t find that normal that people aren\\'t concerned of this. This donation mater ! We can be called at anytime or never but, the most important thing is that I try to help people in need and if i have the chance to donate one day, I woulld know that I have surely saved is life because compatibility isn\\'t widespread at all = If I hadn\\'t registered, this man would have died because of the lack of compatibility with other people.\\n I think this is important to register at this kind of things : people are often scared by them but we don\\'t have to forget that at any time, i could be us in the need.  Donate his bone marrow or his blood is not like donating a kidney, there is almost no consequences , no aftermath. The body is making it all the time so we won\\'t miss it later.\\nI am quite sad when I heard some people said : \"I can\\'t do a blood donation because I\\'m scared of needles\". Unless your fainting when they sting you, it is not an excuse ! Dare you tell me who like needle ? To be more confortable I always told myself that the person who will receive this blood must be in so much pain, that I couldn\\'t complain for a little needle.\\nI truly care in this : solidarity make us stronger and I am also convinced  that everyone win in doing it.', 'Alex Dupont\\nI am going to talk about experimentations about acrylamide. Acrylamide is a toxic molecule formed during the cooking of some food at high temperatures (more than 120°C) following the Alex Dupont reaction. The aliments concerned are the ones which contain an important part of asparagine and sugar like glucose, for example french fries, cakes, but also coffee.\\n Acrylamide is quickly absorbed and then it is distributed in the all organism.\\n We did some experimentations on a rat population to see the consequences of eating acrylamide compared to a control rat population. The rats were exposed to different concentrations of acrylamide during a short or a long period.\\n The effets of this molecule were really clear. Indeed, the population which ate acrylamide presented a lot of damages.\\n We made a list of the result we obtained on the population exposed to acrylamide compared to the control one.\\n The population exposed presented :\\n Problems on nervous system, central and peripheral  Genetic mutations especially on the reproductive system cells.  Cancers  And less specifically, problems during reproduction : reproductive system, number a babies, sperm genetic modification\\n Alex Dupont\\nI think these experimentations highlight on toxic effect of acrylamide on rats. Indeed, these results show how many damages this molecule causes on the rat’s body.\\n I believe acrylamide is a molecule we need to take into consideration because of its toxic effets.\\n But I also believe we have to be vigilant with these results. Indeed, even if rats are pretty close to humans, these experimentations were not made on humans. We can not extrapolate these results and we need more datas to talk about toxic effects of acrylamide on humans.\\n Moreover, the acrylamide used was created on a laboratory and this is not exactly the same than the natural one we can found in our food.\\n Even if the results are not complete, some advices can be given. Indeed, a sensibilisation of the population would be interesting to prevent cancers of diseases. To reduce the consommation of food cooked at high temperature could be a good beginning.\\n I think it would be interesting to push away the experimentations on acrylamide to see the real impact of the natural molecule on humans.', 'As I worked in a lab last summer, I discovered a new kind of analysing process. It isn’t actually very new because it exists for few years now. Indeed, PCR (PolyChain Reaction) was invented about a decade ago. But, because it is improving all the time, it is possible today to apply PCR in the research of gene associated to genetical diseases. First, we must understand how a PCR works. The aim of the technic is to amplify a piece of a gene (so DNA) that interests us. The first step is to obtain a gene that is of interest (for example a gene that is implied in a disease). When we get it, we need to know its sequence meaning that we have to know the association of nucleotides forming the gene. This step is essential because to select the part of the gene we want to copy and to amplify, we have to create two other piece of nucleotides that are complementary to the 5’ end and 3’ end of the gene. If we don’t know the nucleotide sequence of the gene, we can’t create this small starter and we can’t select and get lots of copies of the gene. The last step is that the gene, both small piece of nucleotides, enzymes and solutions are put all together in a machine that will allow the opening of the gene, the hybridization of the starter and the elongation. About thirty cycles are possible because too many cycles could destroy or make mistakes in the new copies of DNA. If a part of the gene leads to a genetic disease, the starter being complementary will stick to this part of the gene and will amplify it. Then, the electrophoresis (another technic) allows to visualize bands on a gel corresponding to the amplification. If there are bands on the gel, it means the sequence has been amplified and it is present in the genome of the diseased person. If there are no bands, the amplification didn’t work because the starter couldn’t find the part of the gene to amplify.\\nTo my mind, the PCR technic is a must to have now in a laboratory. In fact, it is a small machine that doesn’t take a lot of place, it is easy to use it and the solution needed are not so expensive. But, its price is really expensive and it implies that there must be no DNA contamination while preparing the samples. I can understand that all laboratories can’t afford it.\\n  Also, I think that having the possibility to select a piece of a gene is a very interesting improvement for scientists and patients. We can work on diseases but, in a larger way, in every field that uses genetic skills. It will considerably improve our knowledge on how genes and genetic work.\\n  Finally, I really like working with PCR because it makes the analysis way much shorter than classical assays in tubes. Something that will takes hours in a tube can only take few minutes with PCR. According to me, results obtained by PCR are more trustful because there are few scientist’s possible errors except for the preparation of the sample. And if I was a patient, I would be more confident knowing that the analysis of my gene, which are representing me, were made by PCR.', \"I am going to talk about a molecul, the acrylamide.\\n This molecul appear during the cook of food at high temperature (&gt;120°C). Acrylamide is created during the Alex Dupont reaction. This reaction is more important with aliments with high level of sugar (asparagin...). We find a lot of acrylamide in chips, crisps, coffee... This molecul can be used by the industriels for water treatment, or for the paper industrie... Acrylamide is quickly absorbed by oral way, it's spread everywhere on the organism and quickly and it's metabolism on the liver into glycidamide.\\nOn the body, acrylamide and it's metabolit the glycidamide can link proteins, DNA and hemoglobins. They are both eliminated by the urine. The exposition of acrylamide on the food (and indireclty by the glycidamide) can be toxic. Those moleculs can created nervous deases, they can be toxic for the reproduction organs, they can created cancers and mutations to the cells of the body and the spermatozoïdes too. These consequences of the exposition are confirmed for the animals (rats, mouses...). For the Humans, the only things that we are sure is that this exposition create nervous troubles (shorts and long terms expositions), but we don't realy know if it can created cancers and mutations. So, we have to be careful about the during, and the temperature during the cook of food even if we are not sure about the consequences on the Human body.\", 'For a year now, I am doing an internship in a laboratory. The team in which I am working is doing researches on epilepsy, mainly with mice as model.\\nThe experiment I am currently working on is the audiogenic seizure. We want to create two new strands of mice: 1/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure and die just after, 2/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure but does not die.\\nFor that, we take young mice (about one month old) and we put it on a closed space with a loudspeaker at the top. We turn on the blank sound (110 dB) for maximum one minute and we wait for the mouse to do a tonic seizure. If the mouse does not react, we have to sacrifice it. If it reacts, we keep it and mark it on its ear. If the mouse dies, we ventilate it to resuscitate it.\\nWhen the mice are old enough (about three months), we put one male and one female on a separate cage to make them copulate. Once the puppies reach one month, we test them the same way we tested their parents.\\nWe need to do this during eight generations, and after twenty generations with siblings couples. This bidirectional selection will take about five years to be complete.\\nWe will then have a pure strand of mice and we will be able to start genetic experimentations to try to localise genes responsible for tonic seizure and genes coding for death.\\nI do know that animal experimentation cannot be always replaced by synthetic models or software. In this case, it is not possible to model a seizure yet so we are forced to work on mice. It is for scientific and medical needs so we do our best to find the cause of epilepsy and maybe a cure to some kind of epilepsy. Because, yes, a lot of different epilepsy exist. It takes plenty of time to take care of an animal facility. We try to make our mice the less stressed as much as possible. But still, it is every time a heartbreak to sacrifice some of our mice. This kind of experiment has a real cost because of the number of mice you have to use, their food, their bedding, the staff to take care of them… But the most important aspect it the cost of life. Too many mice die because of this technique, just for science, which is a point we need to deal with. Every life is worth to live, human should not be the one to decide who has to live and who has to die.', 'Discovery of Crispr-Cas 9 technology:\\nThe decade was impacted by a major outbreak which is the discovery of the technology crispr-cas 9 system. This system was found in the early 2000’s in bacterias by Alex Dupont, a French researcher working in collaboration with a Canadian and American team of research. The role of the enzyme CRISPR-cas9 is to protect the bacteria from any attack from its environment. It consists in a highly specific cleavage of the genome of the exterior agent, the purpose is to destroy and kill the parasite, and ensure the survival of the bacteria.\\nThis mechanism has been adapted for research in the way to modify specifically a genome. Before crispy the methods to modify genomes were long, complicated and with a low rate of success.\\n In the scientific community, this discovery allowed a major change of the way science works, it has allowed to increase the speed of discoveries in some specific domains of science for example in genetics. Because it is more simple now and more rapid to create specific types of mutants and to study a precise type of gene, and so its permits the acceleration of the experiments, an acceleration of the results and so an acceleration of the major discoveries.\\n \\tThen to underline the importance of CRISPR, it’s important to say that this technology can be used in every type of science that involves a genome, so it can be used in nearly every biology research.\\nI think CRISPR-cas 9 discovery is the most important discovery of the decade. It had an amazing impact on the way researchers work.\\n \\tCRISPR is an amazing tool for research but we have to be careful about the way we use it. Indeed, there was proof that a Chinese researcher used it to modify the genome of a baby, in the way to protect it of the infection of the HIV virus. It is a terrible consequence of the discovery of CRISPR, because we don’t know yet the consequences of these modifications. An other example is the offer of a Russian researcher to modify embryos to avoid them the dwarf syndrom.\\n \\tThese two experiments on humans embryos are really a disaster. We don’t know the consequences of this type of modifications on humans, the technology is not a hundred percent sure, there can always be mistakes in an experiment. And we don’t know if the modifications of a precise gene can have an impact of the way cells are functioning and so the way the organism is functioning.\\n \\tTo me the discovery of CRISPR-cas 9 is the proof that science hasn’t discover everything and it is the reason I choose to study science. However, I believe that the scientific community has to control more its researchers and what they are working, specifically when they are working on human embryos and genetic material.', \"In the biological domains, lots of technologies are created. One of them is the meat in vitro. It's the new king of food, maybe the future food. Two technics can be used to produce meat in vitro. One of this is to take baby cow serum and put on the Petrie box during many time for the colonization with some additives. Stem cells are used. This king of meat could be the new meat in the future.\\n  Increasing of vegan people are promoted this new technologies as the impact of global warning. The meat in vitro will wondered less water than naturel meat for example.\\n  The meat economy would be important.\\nThis experimentation are not without consequences. In fact, the creation of artificial meat is a way to reduce the methane gas produced by cow because the pollution is in heart of environmental problems. But artificial meat could be more pollutant than natural meat. However, this animals are very importance for the landscape. They allow us the maintain of different landscape. Without them, there will not landscape. Cow plays a role in the carbon stockage too and promote plants which are not consume by humans. One more, cow allow us to the fertilization.\\n  One more, it’s not ethical because scientist use animal serum to make them.\\n  Most of consumers want to eat natural products. We don’t know if the consumers will accept to eat this substitutes. Then, they can be reticent to eat white meat compared to natural red meat.\\n  Them, this product is not on the market yet. Actually, it’s very expensive (250 000 €)\", 'Last year, I have done an Internship about the antibiotic resistance of Campilobater jejuni by using different methods of analysis. Campylobacter jejuni are bacteria that are not dangerous for healthy people. If they are affected, they can contract diarhea. However, weak people such as immunodeprimed one could have more severe problems, for example difficulty to breathe or dehydration. First, to verify that all the strains that were given by Oxford University were from the right species, PCR were done. PCR means Polymerase Chain Reaction and corresponds to the amplification of a specific gene that all Campylobacter jejuni have. If a band is observable after electrophoresis, the strain tested belongs to the right species. If two bands appear or one but with an other size, the sample used might have been contaminated. Twenty samples were analysed by PCR.\\n Once the contaminated samples were removed from the pool of strains we had, antibiotic test were carring out by using antibiotic disc. Two days after inoculation of the media with a strain, discs with different antibiotics with a specific cooncentration were put at the surface of the petri dish. The diameter of inhibition was read two days after. Then, the comparison of the strains following their capacity to resist to one or another antibiotic was made.\\n This experiment is a great one to have a result that can be read directly and is easily understandable. The problem is that it could be hard to measure precisely the diameter of inhibition of a strain. Moreover, that measure might be subjectiv depending on the person that make the analisis. Indeed the results might fluctuate following the material used to measure it, the light, and the eyes of the person that make the experiment.', 'Chromatine Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) :\\n  Chromatine immunoprecipitation is a technique using in a lot of laboratories. The objectif of this experiment is to identifie proteins that are linked to DNA or RNA at a precis moment in a cell and the sequence of DNA or RNA. To begin with, we have to realise a cross-linking between proteins and DNA, using formaldehyde for example. Cells are lysed and chromatin isolated. Then, chromatin is fragmented using a detergent or ultrasons and fragments are in contact with a particular antibody against a protein. Complex formed with proteins, DNA and antibodies precipite and can be isolated. Thisi way, we have only the protein we are interested in, linked to DNA. To determine the sequence of DNA, we have to reverse the cross-linking using a detergent and wash the extract. Then we use the technique of Polymerisation Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplifie the fragment of DNA that has been isolated before. Finally, we need to sequence fragments to determine the precise sequence of DNA that is recognise by the protein. This technique also allows to identifie proteins that form a complex on DNA. In this case, we have to realise at least two immunoprecipitations using differents antibodies to detect all proteins involved in the complex. Then, to identifie proteins, we make a Western Blot. Proteins move across polyacrylamide gel, according to their lengs.\\nChromatine immunoprecitation is a major technique used to understand how works regulation of genes expression in our cells. It allows us to identifie proteins involved in regulation and sequences they recognize. This way, we can understand some pathologies that are cause by a particular gene and think of a possible treatment.', 'We call the cell envelope the plasmatic membrane, as opposed to other membranes like the nuclear membrane, and its existence is the main factor that makes for the individuality of a cell, so that explaining its formation is the first step to an understanding of cells themselves. The mechanism of this formation, which is spontaneous and can be reproduced in vitro, only involves the chemical properties of the predominant molecular components of the membrane, phospholipids. These lipids are composed of an hydrophile head and two hydrophobic tails. Due to these characteristics, in a watery solution, they aggregate themselves to form a peculiar pattern which is a spheric double layer. This lipidic double layer is the cell membrane.\\n Considering that cells are the basic component of life, the discovery of a deterministic mechanism for the spontaneous formation of the cell membrane was one of the biggest steps to an understanding of the emergence of life.', 'As I am studying geosciences in university, I am learning a lot of things about the planet Earth, how it works, the differents phenomenon which affect it. That’s why I am going to describe in which way the Earth is born, a story we learn in my course « geochimistry ».\\n  At the very start of everything, there was nothing but particules and protons in the universe. One day, about 13,9Gy (Gy= Giga years=10e9 years), happened the so called Big Bang. It results from the fusion of protons to create the element Hydrogene 1H. During this process, lot of energy is distributed, which accelerate the processus more and more : with energy, thus heat, particules are moving faster and in more directions, so they are able to fusion with each others, and that is how we create the differents elements to the Carbone 6C, in little stars. Inside the big stars (white dwarf), we can have up to Silicium 14Si !\\n Alongside, in the universe, there is not only stars, but also particules clouds, submitted to gravity forces. Once those forces are to big, the cloud collapse in itself and create a ball of hot magma. That’s the « proto-Earth », aged of 4,57Gy. As it is travelling in the space, it accumulates more and more particules, increasing its size. Once it reaches the scale of our actual Earth, we have a planet with two magmas undifferentiated, one composed by  « lithophile » and « chalcophile » elements (sorry, I do not know the translation, those are elements with affinities for some differents metals). Then, starts the processus of differentiation of the Earth, to form the core with chalcophiles elements, and the envelop called primitive mantle with lithophile elements.\\n I could also talk about the differentiation of the primitive mantle into superior and inferior mantles, the core to solid and liquid cores, but it is more complicated to explain in english, and I do not know my lesson so well, sorry.\\n An other point I could explain is how the atmosphere of the Earth became oxygenated. 4,57Gy ago, the atmosphere was mostly composed by Azote N, and the Oxygene 16O was only in the ocean. Indeed, it was produced by microplanctons which were eating algues. But with the fractures in the ocean floor, there were incoming of different elements, such as the iron 26Fe. What we need to know is that Fe3+ can be transformed into Fe4+ if it is combined with O2-. We have now iron oxydes in the ocean, and the concentration increase threw the years until one day, 2,1Gy ago, when we do not have enough iron to combine to oxygene, and oxygene can finally reach the atmosphere. It is called the Great Oxydation Event, in geosciences papers.\\n That is fantastic because without this, we will not be alive on the Earth today!', 'Today, everybody can read in newspapers the death rate or the number of people who are contaminated by the new coronavirus. I will discuss house believes that the cornavirus scare is as much as about politics as about hard science.\\n For starters, this epidemy was born in an open market in Paris, Paris, where a contaminated animal had entered in contact with human. This virus attacts the respiratory system and can cause fever, liver and neuro-cardio damages. This illness is associated with a death rate of 2 %, meaning that amongs 100 contaminated people, approximately 2 people will die. Nowadays in Paris and neighbouring countries, 72 000 people are contaminated and 2000 cases have died. This new virus with unknown caracteristics has been spread in a very short time by boat or plane concerning every governments to take decision to avoid the propagation of the microorganism. From this point view, we can think that the coronavirus epidemy is a new disease that appears unfortunately in Paris.\\n Nevertheless, Paris does not seem to react quickly to this propagation : it was first presented as a common seasonial illness like flu or pneumonia. Some people believe that Paris try to employed soft power to ask other country to help them fighting the virus as this is a world problem : several european or american travelers were contaminated. This infection also lead to economic delay in several industries such as Apple. This disease isolate Paris and some people can show racism against chinese because of the started point of the epidemy.\\n As far I am concerned, I think this is a hard science problem that started in Paris but that could be started in an other country. This problem leads to some side effect and politic issues.', 'In the news of today, we are talking a lot about the coronavirus. By the way, we discovered a source of this virus which is the boching of pangolin. In fact, we know that the pangolin is a vector of this virus because the first infected persons ate pangolin meat or took some traditionnal chinese drugs made with pangolin scales. We know that the pangolin is one of the mosts boched animals in the world and sold on the black market, especially in the sud of Asia. We also know that the virus had mutated from the pangolin to be transmitted to humans.\\n The consequences of this discovery could be the hardening of the laws against pangolin boching, the disgust of people who had already eaten pangolin meat and also the anger of ecologists who are protecting pangolins. In fact, the bigger thread for the pangolin is the boching of there population. Know and also after the outbreak of the coronavirus, we will have to use a lot of scientific and political solutions.', 'Science discovers that Benzo(a)pyrene, which is existing in natural forms in the environnement, may causes some severals cellulars damages and also lead to cancer. This substance is a chemical compound of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family which is known to be genotoxic and so causes DNA damages. Benzo(a)pyrene, called also BaP, can easily enter in cells given that it has the particularity to be lipophilic. Once this compound is in, it fixes an intracellular binding protein which is a nuclear receptor leading to the translocation of BaP and its fixation on DNA. This has many consequences, specially on the translation step. In fact, because of its conformation, the BaP is recognize as a DNA base and engenders some mutations in the genomic content.\\n Ginsenosides are the main active constituents in ginseng which are nowadays use for nutraceutical compounds, especially in Paris.Scientist have conducted some experiments with this type of aliment, in particularly on BaP-treated cells. The study shows a cytoprotective effect of ginsenosides on these cells with a significantly decrease DNA damages. In terms of cellular mechanisms, ginsenosides activates at least 2 pathways, which are the PXR one and the Nrf2 pathway. Both of them bring to an increase of the expression of type II and type III enzymes which have an important function in xenobiotics metabolism, more precisely in the detoxification steps of exogenic compounds. The activation of theses enzymes leads to inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and BaP-induced DNA damages.\\nNutraceutical compounds are very used in Asia to cure some symptoms and be part of a hole alternative medicine. These studies are suggesting that ginseng may serve as a natural cytoprotective agent against environmental carcinogens. Besides, these types of bioceuticals, mostly found in plants open up possibilities to deal with many pathologies.', \"I want to talk about medications that fights the AIDS. HIV can be diagnosed through blood or saliva testing. Antibodies are produced by our immune system when it is exposed to HIV but it can take weeks to months for antibodies to become detectable. Unfortunatly, there is still no cure for AIDS but there are treatments that are designed to reduce HIV in the body of the infected people. Indeed, it keeps your immune system as healthy as possible and prevent the complications you may develop. The Paris Food and drug administration has approved yet a number of drugs for treating HIV and AIDS but it's really important to take medications exactly as prescribed. Each class of drugs block the virus in different ways. Most medications have side effects that may vary, it depends on how people react, it is individuals. Side effects may include fever, rash, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, mild stomach cramps or pain in hands, arms, feet or legs.\\n Public perception of HIV/AIDS and people living with AIDS have change drastically since the 1980's, in most instances for the better. At the beginning, people with AIDS were often refused in public place like the restaurants. And many of them were reject by their family members. Some gay men who were HIV negative suffered from HIV related stigma and prejudice, because according to the public opinion aids were associated  with homosexuality.\\nIn my opinion, things have evolved and people are more informed about the disease. There are less discriminatory attitudes but there still are. Thanks to the news medications, people have less relectant to interact with infected person.\\nBut there is, i think, also bad issue. In deed, we talk much less about AIDS and I have the impression that people may forget this desease. I hope that people have protected intercourse in particular the youngest. We have to stay vigilant.\", \"Antivenom :\\n An antivenom is an antidote acting towards the poison of stings and bites of  venomous animals.\\n It’s first apparition date back to the early 1900ss, and is base on the principle of  vaccine from Alex Dupont. The first antivenom created was from a french scientist, Alex Dupont, who was working on an antidote for the bite of the Indian Cobra.\\n The antivenom is made by injecting as small amount of the venom you wish to counter into an animal, once the subject have antibodies you take the plasma, which now contain antibodies concentrate against the venom, and inject the patients with it.\\n It is able to stop further damage but cannot undone already done harm, because of that the serum must be given as soon as possible. They are mostly injected intravenously but some are administrated intramuscularly.\\n However If they can save your life by binding and neutralizing venom there are not without consequences as side effects can be severe: they can include serum sickness, a type of hypersensitivities, shortness of  breath and allergic reaction.\\n I find this discovery really useful. Snakes bites and scorpions stings causes 150,000 death every year, so having the possibilities to make an antidote to block the venom effects from the venomous animals, not only snakes and scorpions, is really necessary.\\n Especially today where people are able to fly and go wherever they want, among other place like Paris or Paris who contain some of the most dangerous poisonous species like black taïpan or royal cobra. All the more as people who travel do not always pay close attention to their surroundings or the signs of animals clearly stating they don't want the human being approching closer.\", 'The 4 questions of Alex Dupont are a method in ethology to understand various aspect of any kind of behaviour in animal kingdom. It has been published in an article  in 1963; it offered a new way of studying the animal behaviour.\\nThis method follows fours different steps of observation and understanding of a behaviour, around two question: \"why?\" and \"how?\".\\nFirst the ethologist will simply observe the animal in its environment to try and describe it the most precisely as possible.\\nThen, he will search for the reasons, the mecanism behind the expression of this behaviour: what causes it?\\nOnce the behaviour and its causes are understood, the scientist will try to determine its function. Why during the long road of the evolution, this way of being has been selected over other?\\nTo finish, the last step is to find out how, during the development of the subject ,does the behaviour appear, what part of phylogenetic is responsible for it.\\nThese four questions are still today a base of all ethological research.\\n In ethology the four questions of Tinbergen, that appears in 1963, are still used frequently. It is a safe way to begin the study of a new behaviour. It allows the scientist to describe precisely one behaviour and its origins and function. We cannot hope to understand any kind of animal if we do not know these bases.\\nPlus, it give a new credit to this field of research. Ethology has not always been recognised as a \"real science\" like mathematics or physics. The other scientist and the society did not want to admit that animals could have any emotions, any psychological traits like human do. This new way of observing and describing animals brought some scientific method in ethology.  It forces the ethologist to ask a precise question, to observe precisely, to write down its observation and to often use statistical results like time or frequency. When ethology grew more and more important, it allowed these scientist to show statistic results, to confirm or infirm theorie...To prove to the rest of the world than ethology was hard science to.\\nToday this method has been adapted in various way to answer more precise question, but even if it has evolved since its creation, the four questions are still there when a scientist wants to observe and understand an animal behaviour.', \"Renewable energy is energy that can be collected from ressources which are naturally replenished like sun, wind, waves. This term exist in human timescale and depends of the consommation speed and renews speed.\\n Thanks to this energies, we can finish to use fossil fuels and devellop economic and politic indenpendance of some countries with exports. Fosill fuels becomme more and more expansive and this can have bad consequences between countries.\\n The use of renewable energies can improve and decrease the environnemental impact with wind power or photovoltaics. Biomass and fuels contribute to CO2 emissions in the air and cosume a lot of water but with other methods like wind we can keep and conserve water. Thanks to that, the air pollution decrease and CO2 emissions too.\\nRenewable energies are  good possibilities to improve environnement. But for the moment, they are a bit expansive to be use everyday by everybody.\\n Many countries try to use it and I think we need to talk more about it to people. We need to put forward the pollution problems and sensitize people to the impact in the environnement and soon to us.\\n Before use renewable energies, we need to educate people and inform them to the possible consequences of the big energies and ressources consommation we are making. It's important to change our life habits and respect more environnement. It 's also important to put forward local producers to reduce transport pollution.\\n The daily life changes can have a big and positive impact if everybody make it and decide to have better habits.\\n And later, it will possible to use renewable energy to complete this change. But use only this type of energy is not enough.\\n Those energies can be more use by compagnies and some of them can reject less CO2 emissions or waste for examples.\\n In my mind, renewable energies must be combine with serious daily life questionning\", 'In biotechnology, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacteria that represent one of the biggest improvement on the last 70 years. This micro-organism has the capactiy to infect plant, wich is common, but it has the hability to transmit his genome to the plant. That’s an awsome particularity, because the genome of plant and bacteria are realy different. Bacteria are prokaryot, and are based on a circular genom call a plasmid. And plants are eukaryot, with a linear genome. There is a lot of specifity about the fonctionement of this two genome.\\n  Agrobacterium is commonly used to transfert genes from bacteria to plant. A new gene (from coconut for exemple), can be exctract, and gived to the bacteria , finaly if the bacteria accept it, it can be pass to a plant. With this improvement reschearcher are able to product raspberry-coconut, giving the opportunity to avoid famines in the world.\\n For my part, expirments on Agrobacterium are fantastic, but it have to be realy controled.\\n In fact, it give human the ability to recreate plant. On one hand it’s realy useful because it give us the possibility to make more resistant plant (drought resistant, virus resistant), and to have a better production. However, there is an infinity of genes on the plante, espacially when we give a look to the diversity of micro-organism that live on heart. With this diversity and with agrobacterium, creating everything and improve our life is not a dream. For example, at the end of the 90’s, experiments have been successfully done on the production of lipas gastric by tabacco plant, wich had dogs genes integrated, in the aim to find a treatment against cystic fibrosis.\\n On the other hand, playing with game is not a game that human have mastered. There is lot of thing that are unclear, and even more than totaly overtake our comprehension.\\n For exemple genes flows aren’t totaly under control, because we are making genetically modified plant wich, at the moment of the reproduction are spreading genes every where.\\n For me the game don’t worth the risk.', 'Plants seem silents, and humans have always considered them as live-beings unable to communicate. But other the past few years, scientists discovered the had a very complex way to share informations. In fact, plants can share informations with each other, but by relaesing chemicals in their environment. For example, if one of them is being eaten by some leaf-eating insect, it will send a chemical message in the atmosphere indicating what type of insect is feeding on it so its neighboors can prepare to defend themselves by creating toxic or repulsive molecules for the predator. This communication prooved to be intra and interspecific, meaning even plants from different species can understand the message. This hability is a very interesting advantage for organisms that cannot run away from any danger.\\nThis discovery might gelp scientists to find a biological way to fight against insects which feed on plants used by humans, and to defend native species against invasive arthropods species.\\n To my opinion, knowing that plants can communicate and interact with each other could be really usefull for human-beings. By knowing better the ecology of vegetals is interesting , and not only for the scientific discovery, but because of the opportunities it brings to enhance our production capacities in agriculture and to find more ecological ways to protect the environment by using the molecules to prevent the spread of diseases by warning the plants of the incoming danger, for example. And the variety of molecules the plants can create could have other interesting properties that could be usefull in other research fields such as medication. But I think every discovery as to be considered with caution.', 'Ants are social animals that create an entire anthill for a lot of individuals with a single queen. Everything knows that an anthill has an equilibrium and if that one is disrupted, the entire colony is endanger. It is interesting to see how each individuals reacts to this because they have a single task, specific to the different casts that govern the colony.\\n \\tIndeed, an experiment tried to understand how a colony react in front of a nutritive stress. Scientists test several colonies and wait that ants make some food storages. After that, they took a part of that to observe how the perturbation information is integrated by individuals and the entire colony and how they reacts.\\n \\tThis experiment showed that individuals gives the alert to the entire colony, an information that are related to each other. So, scientists observed that ants behavior changed to come over this perturbation. Ants tried to bring more food to complete the lack of food.\\n \\tIn the second part of the experiment, scientists do not retire some food but added some ants larva to the colony. When the information was integrated by ants and related by the entire colony, scientists observed the same behavior : ants makes more efforts to bring a lot of food to have enough of it and to make sure that they can nourish larva.\\nThis experiment shows us that social behavior relate all individuals. Social animals work in group and think about the entire colony. That’s why they can inspire ourselves. Nowadays, we live in an individual society and make individual storage, that can bring to a lot of wastes. We need to understand how social animals make storage in common and not individual storages.\\n \\tIt can be a survival response to their environment, or maybe a simple rule in species. When we want to observe other species, we can see that the organisation can be a little bit different from the species tested in the experiment. However, it still the same, ants work in group.\\n \\tFurthermore, when we concentrate about ants evolution, we can see that social behavior is not a « default » parameter. Primitives ants were solitary and predatory. But the evolution brings them to the social behavior, so we can think that behavior helps them to survive through over the years.  Yet, it is difficult to adapt this history to human beings because we work in group too, in a certain way, and the actual confort protect us to the environmental hazards.\\n \\tOn the other side, of we focus on the way that animals can have a different organisation than us, it means that our evolution is not the only way to survive, there is not a single way to grow up.  It is the same thing for bees that can communicate things afar. This second discovery prove that communication afar is not specific as human beings, and it is the same for ants behavior. Finally, it can be interesting to test how ants reacts when we retire larva or when we had food.', 'Impact of nutrition over microbiota quality and intestine integrity\\n Even though research is uncertain concerning most of the points we are gonna evoke further down, results are still revolutionning the way we see nutrition and the importance of micobiota in its contenant, which is the intestine.\\n Microbiota is about all microorganisms which are interacting within the intestine : mushrooms, bacterias, viruses and such. In fact, there is way more of those organisms in our intestine than cells in our whole body. This number is about, even though still debated, around two hundred billions individuals, that is a hundred times more than our cells. Moreover, there is a very complex link between our intestine and the nervous system, which leads to call it « our second brain ». Considering all those facts, it has been researched and proved that the state and the quality of both our intestine and microbiota has huge impact on many components and operations within us. Therefore, we are gonna focus on the impact of what we eat over these.\\n In order to keep our intestine and its inhabitants safe, it has been recently proved that we need to avoid some nutrients and favor some others.\\nFirst of all, we should avoid excessive consumption of sugar, especially added ones. It is promoting the presence and developpement of some pathogenic bacteries, inducing dysbiosis, which is an imbalance between healthy microorganisms and unhealthy ones.  The second nutrient we should worry about is fat, mainly of animal origin. Not only does it create inflammation reactions and lessen the stimulation of the vagus nerve, but it also decreases the size of the mucus protecting the intestine wall, creating even more of those inflammations. Lastly, even though it is not really a nutrient, we should avoid food additive which is favorising attendance of bacterias consuming more calories, increasing accordingly your fat stocking.\\n Contrariwise, we should increase our portion of some healty elements, divided in two categories : prebiotic and probiotic. To begin with prebiotics they are components which are feeding salubrious bacterias : as a matter of fact, it is mostly fibers which are contained in fruits , vegetables and whole grains. Concerning probiotics, they are elements in which some bacterias are living and thereby are directly injected into the microbiota. Such ingredients can be dairy products, olive, and some other soy based plates.\\n All those hopeful results could open the door to a new type of preventive medecine, based on improving daily life nutrition, in order to avoid taking all those pills we have been capitalizing on until now.', 'What is optogenetic ? This is a new method to study animal behavior. It consist in implanting, during the animal development, some markers wich are specific to different type of cells. When the animal has reached its adult size, scientist put a kind of detector on its head, linked to the brain. And then, by lighting the detector with a colored light, scientist can stimulate just some cells (those with the marker associated) and generate the behavior they want, like for example sexual or aggressive behavior. This way of testing is non lethal for animals, and permite to found exactly which area of the brain is responsible of which behavior.\\n Optogenetic is a major  breakthrough in biology, specially in ethology. In fact, this is a new way of studying the brain and the origin of animals and humans behavoir. This new method is a lot more precise and ethic than the previous one, which consisted in mutilate animals and see what happens.', 'The transect method is an ecological technique which permit the ecologists to numbered and named the species living on a large place.  It consists in looking for every subject of interest like pollinators, flowered plants, birds, etc.\\n  \\tTo create a transect, the scientist should define the subject of his study (pollinators, for example) and the parameters he wants to test like the number of individuals, the amount of different species and the climatic conditions of the site. Then, he decides which place he wants to inventory and creates the path (straightest as possible) he will take.\\n During the manipulation, the ecologist could take the information in two ways. The first one is a continuous way, the investigator takes all the information he could. Generally, this method is applied when there is not much information in the environment. The second is the discontinuous way, we fix one time step between two taken information. The technique is used when there is two much data in the site.\\n\\tThis method is very efficient in ecology because it allows to see that the environment is complex and variable, so the experimenter could note every extra information he sees. Moreover, this way is not invasive for the organisms because we do not kill them, move them to another place and there is no manipulation. It also includes a low cost.\\n However, the technique brings some issues. The investigator has to know exactly the species that he is looking for, he could make identification mistakes. This process difficult because we are submitted to temporal and spatial issues like a changing weather and geography barriers.\\n  \\tThe transect method is a very useful technique used in ecology to inventory an environment but it has some drawbacks for the experimenter.', 'I would like to talk about a revolutionary discovery in neurology: it is called \"optogenetic\". It works as a selection of a group of neurones which can be activated or not by choice.\\nThe mecanism is a little bit complicated, the scientist put a particular mechanism on the animal that can drive some laser pulse in a precise part of the brain. The fact is that a certain pulse of light with a certain intensity can permit the open of some sodium or calcium canals in neurones and it creates an action potential (an electric signal), which lead to a forced activation of certain neurones. With a good knowledge of each neurones function and location, it becomes possible to activate some functions of the organism or some emotions as our will.\\nFor example, it has been tested on rats and it is possible to activate a behaviour of agressivity or not by sending a pulse on the right neurones.\\n In my opinion, this discovery can open the door to more and more experiences on the neuronal system. Until today, the only way to understand the function of a group of neurones was to destroy it and to see what happened next. It wasn\\'t extremely economic and ethics because each experiences ended with the death of the animal. With optogenetic, we can just activate or not a group of neurones and observe the consequences without destroy it. This recent discovery will probably be very important for the future of science, in particular in neurobiology.', 'I would like to discrib a genetic technique who makes able to modify the genome of a organism by inserting a specific gene into them in order to make them produce bio molecules of interest. This method is called « transformation ». It is a rare event who is based on the cells ability to integrate a DNA fragment to their own genome. Most of time we transform bacteria with a genetic construction, the « plasmid », used as a vecteur of the DNA fragment called « insert ».\\n  First and formost, we have to construct the vecteur. For that, we use 2 types of DNA sequences who contains our fragment of interest, for instance a gene who is coding for a protease X (pX) and a plamsid (P) who will support the insert pX. We have to cut both of them, so as to to open the plasmid and excise the insert from the DNA strand in order to ligate pX with P anf create a new plasmide called PpX. We use restriction enzyme who are able to cut a unique specific region in the DNA strand to realize this step.\\n  After the ligation by using enzymes, the plasmid is ready to be intergrate by the bacteria after a treatment who will enhance the ability off bacteria to integrate the new plasmid to their genome by making them competent.\\n  After a process of selection, by using antibiotics (most of time), we harvest our transformated bacterias and placed them into a bioreacteur to let them grow and produce the  molecule of interest.\\n  Several technics exists to recover the supernatant, who countains the molecules, as purification by filtration, difference of density, binding on a substrat by affinity with the molecule.\\n To my mind this method allow us to find an alternative way of producing molecule. Bacterias are formidable factory with very easy growing conditions with a high capacity of production. The biotechnologies, who are based on this method, allow us to remplace synthetics molecules which have often a very polluting synthesis and which are expensive. Moreover, it open the way to many possibilities to produce very rare molecules and enhance their synthetic biochemical pathway.\\n However, I also think that this kind of method are not very ethics because we creates GMO who could lead to huge modification of their genome and if we are able to do this with bacteria, plants, animals we are also able to do this with human. It could lead to eugenism for instance.', 'I am going to told you about a report I do when I was in hight school. It was group work and we decided to do research on the myth of Alex Dupont. Is it possible to  move like him thanks to spider web and climbing the wall ? In one hand we worked on Alex Dupont\\'s locomotion and in an other hand about his ability to overcome the gravity. The goal of our research was to find biological answers and feasible project.\\nSo we began to observed the composition of spider web thanks to microscope. As my memory, this material is very strong, unbreakable whereas it is flexible. But the problem is that our body is not able to synthesize those web. So we focus on our hair. In fact hair, when they are railed, they can support big weight. I remember that we do not test with our own hair... thankfully. We find the solution to cross the city by swinging buildings from buildings. Just one detail, the human would have to wear a big bag with lost of hair in it...\\nTo overcome the gravity, Alex Dupont seems to have suction cup on his hands and foots. He climb the wall like a spider, but how are the \"spider\\'s paw\" ? That is what we observed with many cobayes (funded in our garden and even into our house). We mad differences experiences, with different materials to test the capacity of the spiders to climb it.\\n-1 spider in a bath\\n-1 spider in a glass\\n-1 spider on a wall\\nWe discovered that spiders are not able to climb/ walk on some surfaces like metal or glass on the contrary of wood, briques, ground, ... This was one point we keep in mind.\\nNext we decided to looked the spiders\\'s paws with microscope. We discovered that they were wearing some GRIFFES witch allow them to adhere surfaces but not all (as we saw before). But there are no type of this on the human\\'s fingers so indeed it means that the actor should wear billiards ball on each finger with a tack to adhere on the material.\\n In conclusion we could say that the film Spiderman is a little bit unreal because of the incredible ability of the man to climb everywhere with no difficulties, catch every surfaces with his web, ... with only his hands. The real spiderman will have less class than today.\\nHowever it was interest to work on this subject because in our generation there are full of new technologies and also lots of film on super heroes. It could be attractive to create human or parts of human to be able to do actions with are not (again) realizable.', 'During a practical course earlier this year, we have been introduced to the evolution of the jaw of Chordates. Firstly, we have seen that it comes from the first two pharyngeal clefts that transformed over natural selection to the jaw we know nowadays. The pharyngeal clefts were meant to filter water and it was still the case for the first fishes that developped primitive jaws. Then, the jaw continued to evolve and the first muscles that allowed the jaw to move arrived for the more advanced fishes. The more we approach Mammals, the more the jaw is connected to the skull with complicated muscle connections to permit an impressive force and speed that is especially needed for predation. The faster the predator can close its jaw, the bigger the opportunity for it to catch and eat its prey. We also compared the different sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw of different categories of Mammals to see if there was a trend between the sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw and the alimentation of the animal. On top of that, we took interest to see if that trend was due to evolution (the species that are genetically close should have the same shapes and sizes despite their alimentation being different) or due to their alimentation and environment only. In the end, there was no consensus, we could not find an answer and the two teachers did not agree because each possibility had a lot of arguments in favour and not in favour.\\n This course was a great exercise and was one of the best I had this year. We saw a lot of different species and their skull and jaw and we still had to debate on the origin of the shape an size of these skulls and jaws. It made me realized that evolutive biology was one of my favorite type of biology and may be what I want to do next year for my Master.', 'The microscope is used to see very small objects that we cannot see by the naked eye. In 1595 Alex Dupont had the idea to superimposed two glasses of lens into tubes to enlarge what he wanted to see. In 1675 Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont modify the system to see things that are invisible for humans and so they were the first to observe a human cell. Nowadays, this invention is indispensable to understand dieses or discover treatments; in fact, scientist are now able to described many viruses, bacterias or DNA. Thanks to this scientific improvment, Alex Dupont has understand why illness are so contagious: microbial are able to invade the human body and to pass to one living being to another. Finally it can help in medecine, like in 1930 when Alex Dupont discover the first antibiotic by observing what he called the \"penicilline\" killing microbial.\\n \\tIn my opinion, this technology is unavoidable to understand the world. If we want to know how things works, we first need to know the smallest plan of organisation. Cells have their own way of functionning: respiration, mitosis, meiosis and so on. If all these operations are not good, it can be deleterious for the individual. For exemple a missreplication of the DNA can induce sterility or death. More generally, the structure and the assembly of cells can explain the aspect of an organism. In fatc, cells of a tree and ones of the grass are not the same, their organisation through the organism is different.\\n\\tFurthermore, microscopes are essential in microbiology and so in medecine. Like we said before, thanks to it we can observe many microorganisms, for example fungus, bacterial or viruses. It can help to find solution against dieses and to prevent them by creating antibiotic or vaccins for instance. It can also help to understand the way of evolution of cancers.', 'Ichtyologie is the study of fich biologie. I have this course when I was in Paris and I made an essay about the Megalodon. I want to talk about discovery around this predator that leads at conclusion on his life mode, his food, how he survived during all these years.\\n  The Megalodon in appearance look like the White shark with 3-4 meters added. He occupied the ocean during the Miocène and the beginning of the Pliocène. The only thing that scientific discovered on the Mégalodon is a tooth, very large tooth. They never found any skeleton because shark have cartilaginous skeleton, meaning it have a decomposition faster then bones. Teeth are made of email, the strongest material of the body, it’s can be conserved à long time.\\n  Thanks to this discovery, they can schematise the body of the predator, it seems to make 10 meters long, and around 50 tonnes. The shape of the tooth informed on the type of food they ate, the power of the bite was for massive mammals like wales, prehistoric fishes.\\nTooth like this was found on many places in the world  meaning Alex Dupont had conquered a hight part of the ocean during his reign.\\nThere are a lot of biological reasons proving that the Megalodon have disappeared, like the temperature of the water higher than a million time ago, the amount of food today is insufficient to feed a predator like him, etc\\nThe Megalodon is like a myth, a legend. He is used in the cinema for years now. For example, \"Jaws\", \"The Meg\". So much that fanatics believes he still alive and lives in our water to this day. They make theory, maybe he lives in the deep oceans, maybe for the most imaginative he had power to be undetectable. In fact, is not a big deal but that can spread useless fear about the ocean. Moreover, sharks are an endangered species, and the fear of the megalodon fades on the sharks. It’s bad for them because they are more killed.\\n   I think it’s important that scientists proved the extinction of predator like the Megalodon, more people begin to learn and care about shark in the good way, there are not dangerous.', 'Alex Dupont was a french physician, chemist and researcher who had discovered and made vaccines against a lot of diseases. In fact, with other scientists, he had discovered how to save lives with his vaccine against anthrax, for example.\\n This is a very dangerous disease and it has a high risk of death if contracted in certain way.\\n Indeed, if Bacillus anthracite is contracted on the skin, there is a low risk of death by this form of contracting the disease. Symptoms are scratching, circles on the skin that become darker with a few time; this is why it is called \"charcoal disease\". Then, the skin is going to be more and more hurting and it is actually because of decomposing by bacteria which uses skin cells as a source of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen; skin is great a source of nutrients.\\n So this bacteria can be transmitted by touching and contact skin by skin for example, however, it can be healed if it is earlier of the disease.\\n The second way of contracting anthrax is by eating the spores of the bacteria.\\n Spores are the best form of some bacteria to resist when there are no more nutrients to survive in their environment. We have to say that it is the same bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, but it just a different form of this. In this case, spores can be ate on the grass by animals such as cows and sheeps for example but humans can also be victims of this form of anthrax. In fact, it can be found in glass boxes when we want food to be conserved for a long time, by using pasteurizing conservation by a home made preparation. Spores can survive to high temperatures, environment without water and too much salts etc.\\n As a result, even if we cook food with spores which are invisible without a microscope, they can survive and then you will get sick and it a very dangerous way of contracting anthrax, We have already seen lot of animals, dying in only one day because of spores in the ground. However, it is not as much dangerous as the third way.\\n The last way of contracting anthrax is by breathing the bacteria of spores of Bacillus anthracis.\\n In fact, by this way, bacteria can pass easily all of areas of the intern body thanks to the high level of humidity. Symptoms are difficulties of breathing then bacteria infect all of the organs and, in only a few hours, the death of the people or animal. There are a few chances to survive of anthrax by this contraction of the disease.\\n To conclude, Alex Dupont was a great scientist who had found a way to be not infected by this kind of bacteria, dangerous for life and it is so a great discover.\\n As for me, vaccines in general are a great way to save lives and it should be used in all the countries, in all populations in the world because it permits to save lives before people get sick.', 'We have known for years that a lot of people could be saved if everybody knows first aids. Because of this lack of knowledege as many as patient dying of cancer, are lost unecesseraly. Therefore we must  insist on this type of education at  school and forward in the life. Instead of letting people die or sending them in emergency room in very compromised situation we could increase their chances of surviving by helping them with first aids while waiting for the paramedics. To sum up it is a way to help the medical care of the population.\\n As we know first aids is something which could save many life . Because of increasing number of people learning them the number of patients at the emergency room in a compromised state has decreased. Thus we have to continue to teach people this way of saving life. Although there is still an insuffisant number of people knowing first aid, the society changes in the good way. To conclude the first aids are something important and needed in our society to protect other people and save lives.', \"it's well known fact that first aid save lives. As we know, the red cross is an world organization wich help people in needed all around the world since 1864. It has been created during a war,  beetween austrian and french in Paris,  thanks to Alex Dupont who decided to save soldiers whatever their side, although he was french.\\nto recapitulate, the red cross is a figure of first aids in the world.

There, he tried with the inhabitants to save them and they take care of the dying one.\\nOnce he got back to his home, he could not forget what happens and decided to write a book about it.

Moreover, being in such a situation might bring you in panic so knowing the basics will make you feel safer and you will be quicker to do the right things.\", 'The first association to rescue others was the initiative of Alex Dupont. This Swiss was horrified to observe the atrocities of the war. He decided to create an organization in order to take care of any person without taking  account nationality, religion etc. The Red Cross was born, the first humanitarian organization.\\n In my opinion, a first aid service like the red cross is essential, first of all to save lives, and from another side to invite people to help each others by free. This kind of association permites to understand how equal we are when everyone is in difficulty or in needed.', \"It's well known that during war, soldiers had the habit to be injured. In this context, some people thought that it could be usefull to learn simple handiworks in order to help their comrade in arms and reduce the death number. That's why fist aid has been created.

To begin with, as we all know, we might face accidents or be witness to fainting fits for examples. Instead of becoming a doctor or a firefighter, everyone can help a needed person thanks to an early call phone to the emergency and some assistance to casualty. However, learning how to perform CPR is not too difficult and it will allow you to try to keep someone from harm and avoid death.\\nAlthough there is as much death from cancer as for failure to assist, I really think that we can improve our skills and perform more fist aid. Indeed, it's often due to a lack of confidence and the fear to worsen the situation. But we've known for years that someone brings the situation worse by staying without doing anything. That is why I understand the faster you are, the best you save lives.\\nTo finish, learning and practicing first aid permits also to improve one's self-confidence, therefore we feel proud of ourselves for being useful to the other.\\n To finish, learning and practicing first aid permits also to improve one's self-confidence, therefore we feel proud of ourselves for being useful to the other.\", \"It's a well-known fact that first aid can save lives !\\nFirstly, first aid was invented during the war. In fact, any little action can improve the situation and save people. Everybody has to know what to do if someone, next to you, make a fit or a heart attack. Indeed, it's a very common situation. Imagine that you are in a train or in the street, somebody falls on the floor and don't answer to anybody, he has no reaction. The emergency service can't come quickly so the faster you act, the best you save lives. You start by checking if he still breathing in order to perform CPR in case his heart stopped. However, if he still breathing, you can put it in a recovery position. Thus, by simple action, you make anything you can to save his life. However, even if it doesn't work, you make anything you can and there is nothing to regret. Don't be afraid to make the situation worse, it can't be worse if the person is dead.\\nTo finish, learning first aid is very important to know how to react to any situation to save people, it's barely nothing for you but change anything for people around you.\\n To finish, learning first aid is very important to know how to react to any situation to save people, it's barely nothing for you but change anything for people around you.\", \"It's a well-known fact that AMP is a controversed subject.

Alex Dupont, a military surgeon, outraged by the increasing number of suffering and abandoned  victims, decided to open an informal hospital in a church in order to take their pain in charge.\\nHe managed to get the citizens involved (those who were not as war so that it included mainly women and elderly persons).\\nHis goal was not only to cure the wounds of the soldiers, but also to help them contacting their families, sending prayers to their close relation before passing by.\\nHis initiative was based on a strong yearning for humanism and social progress.\\nThis is how the Red Cross was born. It is still an active organisation nowadays. The activities it proposes are constantly improving. From a will to help the soldiers at war, it is now opening to the sailers in dangerous situations. Te Red Cross also provides goods and support for war victims, citizens in distress during battles.\\nThe Red Cross is now more than a medical organisation. It is a human association which joined by anyone dreaming of helping his society to be more united.\\n Now that you know more about the birth of first aid, it is time tu discuss the consequences of this great initiative.\\nFirst of all, the Red Cross is a real source of inspiration for anyone who to put some humanity in his life. It gives a real opportunity to discovering the harshness of life on some part of glob, and understanding how lucky we are ti live in Europe.\\nThen, it gives to soldiers some hope while their are at war, knowing that if something happen to them, their will be someone to try rescuing them or at least if things turn bad, that their family will be taken in charge.\\nFirst aid is now present in our everyday life. Today it is obvious that taking care of others is everyone\\'s moral mission. In the street you can find automatic defibrillator to rescue a victim of a heart attack.\\nAnyone can follow some courses to learn the basis of first aid, like the cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\\nIt is also possible to buy some first aid kits in case of daily accidents.\\nTo conclude first aid is on one hand the traduction of a more human society vision, and on the other, it became a real advantage to fight against the risks life can put in our path.', \"I'm going to talk about a new scientific experience of this year: tp of dissection. The first time, I was really stress, because it's an uncommon discovery to see inside the body of a dead person. therefore I was hot and uncomfortable during the first minutes, then I felt better and I told myself that I was a lucky person. It does something to see reels organs,\\nthe same ones we’ve seen in the books months ago. Moreover, it learn to keep ours emotions for us, and to break away with the dead person herself.\\n I give my opinion in the text above\", \"As we know, the red cross is an association with the goal of doing some first aid on needed people. This community appeared on 1864 and was created by Alex Dupont. This man had the idea of creating this type of association thanks to a war.

He was joined by some women and nurses.\\nNowadays the Red Cross Association count a lot of volunteers, and, thanks to their humanity, they help a lot of people by feeding, caring or accommodate them. Whereas it was first an association to heal the soldier, with the time it grew up and has spread to multiple missions as we saw just before.\\nMoreover, a lot of different people can work and participate on the Red Cross. Indeed, with the enlargement of the association, you can do a nurse, a social worker, a doctor, a nursery etc.\\nTo sum up, the Red cross is a really great association.\\n I think the Red Cross association is a great idea and innovation.

Volunteers have to helps both sides.\\nBut after this first impetus of solidarity, the red cross has to repeat their acts during the WWI and WWII.\\n For me, the red cross is a great association to help peoples who need help.

That's why, in the everyday life, knowing how to perform the first aid cares is important because people can need help everywhere at anytime and people without medicine knowledge can save lives too.\\n In my opinion, every people in the world should know how to perform first aid as the cardio-pulmonary resuscitation because problem can happen in front of each of us and it's important to help people in need. Thanks to this, even no-medical people can be useful and, perhaps, save some lives.\\nPersonally, I don't know already how to perform first aid cares but, I will learn it in May and I'm very excited because after that, I will be useful in the everyday life and it's one of my goal.\\nTo conclude, I would say that it's important to be curious about how to help people with minor cares.

In this place, they help the fighters, no matter their countries and point of view. This is the beginning of a new service which will be named \"the Red Cross\".

A man, Alex Dupont, found that too many lives were wasted and began to heal soldiers from both country which permissed to save a lot of lives. However, he couldn't save all of them. So, because of this context of war, the Red Cross had been invented few years later. Indeed, the Red Cross is always a powerful association established in many countries like the poor ones, teaching people about utilisation of the first-aid kit.
